born August 30, 1930) [ 2 ] is an American investor and philanthropist who currently serves as the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway . As a result of his investment success, Buffett is one of the best-known investors in the world. According to Forbes , as of 17 February 2025, Buffett's estimated net worth stood at US$149.6 billion, making him the seventh richest individual in the world. [ 3 ] Buffett was born in Omaha, Nebraska . The son of US congressman and businessman Howard Buffett , he developed an interest in business and investing during his youth. He entered the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1947 before graduating from the University of Nebraska at 20. He went on to graduate from Columbia Business School , where he molded his investment philosophy around the concept of value investing pioneered by Benjamin Graham . He attended New York Institute of Finance to focus on his economics background and soon pursued a business career. He later began various business ventures and investment partnerships, including one with Graham. He created Buffett Partnership Ltd. in 1956 and his investment firm eventually acquired a textile manufacturing firm, Berkshire Hathaway, assuming its name to create a diversified holding company . Buffett emerged as the company's chairman and majority shareholder in 1970. In 1978, fellow investor and long-time business associate Charlie Munger joined Buffett as vice-chairman. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Since 1970, Buffett has presided as the chairman and largest shareholder of Berkshire Hathaway, one of America's foremost holding companies and world's leading corporate conglomerates . He has been referred to as the \"Oracle\" or \"Sage\" of Omaha by global media as a result of having accumulated a massive fortune derived from his business and investment success. [ 6 ] [ 7 ] He is noted for his adherence to the principles of value investing, and his frugality despite his wealth. [ 8 ] Buffett has pledged to give away 99 percent [ 9 ] of his fortune to philanthropic causes, primarily via the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation . He founded the Giving Pledge in 2010 with Bill Gates , whereby billionaires pledge to give away at least half of their fortunes. [ 10 ] Early life and education Warren Edward Buffett was born on August 30, 1930, in Omaha, Nebraska , as the second of three children and the only son of Leila (n\u00e9e Stahl) and Congressman Howard Buffett . [ 11 ] He began his education at Rose Hill Elementary School. In 1942, his father was elected to the first of four terms in the United States Congress , and after moving with his family to Washington, D.C., Warren finished elementary school, attended Alice Deal Junior High School and graduated from what was then Woodrow Wilson High School in 1947, where his senior yearbook picture reads: \"likes math; a future stockbroker\". [ 12 ] After finishing high school and finding success with his side entrepreneurial and investment ventures, Buffett wanted to skip college to go directly into business but was overruled by his father. [ 13 ] [ 14 ] Buffett showcased an interest in business and investing at a young age. He was inspired by a book he borrowed from the Omaha public library at age seven, One Thousand Ways to Make $1000 . [ 15 ] Much of Buffett's early childhood years were enlivened with entrepreneurial ventures. In one of his first business ventures, Buffett sold chewing gum, Coca-Cola , and weekly magazines door to door . He worked in his grandfather's grocery store. While still in high school, he made money delivering newspapers, selling golf balls and stamps, and detailing cars, among other means. On his first income tax return in 1944, Buffett took a $35 deduction for the use of his bicycle and watch on his paper route. [ 16 ] In 1945, as a high school sophomore, Buffett and a friend spent $25 to purchase a used pinball machine, which they placed in the local barber shop . Within months, they owned several machines in three different barber shops across Omaha. They later sold the business to a war veteran for $1,200. [ 17 ] Investor Benjamin Graham was a major influential figure on the young Warren Buffett. Buffett's interest in the stock market and investing dated back to his schoolboy days spent in the customers' lounge of a regional stock brokerage near his father's own brokerage office. His father took interest in cultivating and educating the young Warren's curiosity surrounding the subject of business and investing, even at one point taking him to visit the New York Stock Exchange when he was 10. [ 18 ] At 11, he bought three shares of Cities Service Preferred for himself, and three for his sister Doris Buffett (who also became a philanthropist). [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] At 15, Warren made more than $175 monthly delivering Washington Post newspapers. In high school, he invested in a business owned by his father and bought a 40-acre farm worked by a tenant farmer. [ 22 ] He bought the land when he was 14 years old with $1,200 of his savings. [ 22 ] By the time he finished college, Buffett had amassed $9,800 in savings (about $130,000 today). [ 17 ] [ 23 ] In 1947, Buffett matriculated at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania . He would have preferred to focus on his business ventures, but enrolled due to pressure from his father. [ 17 ] Warren studied there for two years and joined the Alpha Sigma Phi fraternity. [ 24 ] He then transferred to the University of Nebraska where he graduated with a Bachelor of Science in business administration in 1951. [ 25 ] After being rejected by Harvard Business School in the spring of 1950, Buffett enrolled at Columbia Business School of Columbia University upon learning that Benjamin Graham taught there. He earned a Master of Science in economics from Columbia in 1951. [ 26 ] After graduating, Buffett attended the New York Institute of Finance . [ 27 ] The basic ideas of investing are to look at stocks as business, use the market's fluctuations to your advantage, and seek a margin of safety . That's what Ben Graham taught us. A hundred years from now they will still be the cornerstones of investing. [ 28 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] \u2014 Warren Buffett Business career Further information on Warren Buffett's time at Berkshire Hathaway: List of assets owned by Berkshire Hathaway Early business career Buffett worked from 1951 to 1954 at his father's firm, Buffett-Falk & Co., as an investment salesman; from 1954 to 1956 at Graham-Newman Corp. as a securities analyst; from 1956 to 1969 at several investment partnerships as the general partner; and from 1970 as chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc . In 1951, Buffett discovered that Graham was on the board of GEICO insurance. Taking a train to Washington, D.C., on a Saturday, he knocked on the door of GEICO's headquarters until a janitor admitted him. There he met Lorimer Davidson, GEICO's vice president, and the two discussed the insurance business for hours, and Buffett made his first purchase of GEICO stock. [ 31 ] Davidson would eventually become Buffett's lifelong friend and a lasting influence, [ 32 ] and would later recall that he found Buffett to be an \"extraordinary man\" after only fifteen minutes. Buffett wanted to work on Wall Street but both his father and Ben Graham urged him not to. He offered to work for Graham for free, but Graham refused. [ 33 ] Buffett returned to Omaha and worked as a stockbroker while taking a Dale Carnegie public speaking course. [ 34 ] Using what he learned, he felt confident enough to teach an \"Investment Principles\" night class at the University of Nebraska-Omaha . The average age of his students was more than twice his own. During this time he also purchased a Sinclair gas station as a side investment but it was unsuccessful. [ 35 ] In 1954, Buffett accepted a job at Benjamin Graham 's partnership. His starting salary was $12,000 a year (about $141,000 today). [ 23 ] There he worked closely with Walter Schloss . Graham was adamant that stock picks should provide a wide margin of safety after weighing the trade-off between their price and their intrinsic value. In 1956, Benjamin Graham retired and closed his partnership. At this time Buffett, who had amassed personal savings over $174,000 (about $2.01\u00a0million today) [ 23 ] , decided to return to Omaha, where he would quickly start a series of investment partnerships. In 1957, Buffett operated three investment partnerships. By 1959, the total had grown to six partnerships. That summer, Buffett was introduced to his future partner Charlie Munger during a business luncheon at The Omaha Club . [ 36 ] In 1961, Buffett revealed that 35% of the partnership's assets were invested in the Sanborn Map Company . He explained that Sanborn stock sold for only $45 per share in 1958, but the company's investment portfolio was worth $65 per share. This meant that Sanborn's map business was being valued at \"minus $20\". Buffett eventually purchased 23% of the company's outstanding shares as an activist investor , obtaining a seat for himself on the board of directors, and allied with other dissatisfied shareholders to control 44% of the shares. To avoid a proxy fight , the board offered to repurchase shares at fair value, paying with a portion of its investment portfolio. 77% of the outstanding shares were turned in. [ 37 ] [ 38 ] Buffett had reaped a 50 percent return on investment in just two years. [ 39 ] Assuming Berkshire In 1962, Buffett became a millionaire with the success of his partnerships, which by then had grown to 11 entities and held in excess of $7,178,500, of which over $1,025,000 belonged to Buffett. At the start of the year, he merged the various partnerships into the single entity Buffett Partnership, Ltd., which would be his primary investment vehicle for the remainder of the decade. [ 40 ] Buffett invested in and eventually took control of a textile manufacturing company, Berkshire Hathaway . He began buying shares in Berkshire from Seabury Stanton , the owner, whom he later fired. Buffett's partnerships began purchasing shares at $7.60 per share. In 1965, when Buffett's partnerships began purchasing Berkshire aggressively, they paid $14.86 per share while the company had working capital of $19 per share. This did not include the value of fixed assets (factory and equipment). Buffett took control of Berkshire Hathaway at a board meeting and named a new president, Ken Chace, to run the company. In 1966, Buffett closed the partnership to new money. He later claimed that the textile business had been his worst trade. [ 41 ] He then moved the business into the insurance sector, and, in 1985, the last of the mills that had been the core business of Berkshire Hathaway was sold. In a second letter, Buffett announced his first investment in a private business\u00a0\u2014 Hochschild, Kohn and Co, a privately owned Baltimore department store. In 1967, Berkshire paid out its first and only dividend of 10 cents. [ 42 ] In 1969, Buffett liquidated the partnership and transferred their assets to his partners including shares of Berkshire Hathaway. He lived solely on his salary of $50,000 per year and his outside investment income. In 1973, Berkshire began to acquire stock in the Washington Post Company . Buffett became close friends with Katharine Graham , who controlled the company and its flagship newspaper and joined its board. In 1974, the SEC opened a formal investigation into Buffett and Berkshire's acquisition of Wesco Financial , due to possible conflict of interest. No charges were brought. In 1977, Berkshire indirectly purchased the Buffalo Evening News for $32.5\u00a0million. Antitrust charges started, instigated by its rival, the Buffalo Courier-Express . Both papers lost money until the Courier-Express folded in 1982. In 1979, Berkshire began to acquire stock in ABC . Capital Cities announced a $3.5\u00a0billion purchase of ABC on March 18, 1985, surprising the media industry, as ABC was four times bigger than Capital Cities at the time. Buffett helped finance the deal in return for a 25% stake in the combined company. [ 43 ] The newly merged company, known as Capital Cities/ABC (or CapCities/ABC), was forced to sell some stations due to Federal Communications Commission ownership rules. The two companies also owned several radio stations in the same markets. [ 44 ] In 1987, Berkshire Hathaway purchased a 12% stake in Salomon Inc., making it the largest shareholder and Buffett a director. In 1990, a scandal involving John Gutfreund (former CEO of Salomon Brothers ) surfaced. A rogue trader , Paul Mozer, was submitting bids in excess of what was allowed by Treasury rules. When this was brought to Gutfreund's attention, he did not immediately suspend the rogue trader. Gutfreund left the company in August 1991. [ 45 ] Buffett became chairman of Salomon until the crisis passed. [ 46 ] In 1988, Buffett began buying The Coca-Cola Company stock, eventually purchasing up to 7% of the company for $1.02\u00a0billion. [ 47 ] It would turn out to be one of Berkshire's most lucrative investments and one which it still holds. [ 48 ] As a billionaire In 1998 Buffett acquired General Re (Gen Re) as a subsidiary in a deal that presented difficulties \u2014 according to the Rational Walk investment website, \"underwriting standards proved to be inadequate\", while a \"problematic derivatives book\" was resolved after numerous years and a significant loss. [ 49 ] Gen Re later provided reinsurance after Buffett became involved with Maurice R. Greenberg at AIG in 2002. [ 50 ] With President Barack Obama at the White House in July 2011 During a 2005 investigation of an accounting fraud case involving AIG, Gen Re executives became implicated. On March 15, 2005, the AIG board forced Greenberg to resign from his post as chairman and CEO after New York state regulators claimed that AIG had engaged in questionable transactions and improper accounting. [ 51 ] On February 9, 2006, AIG agreed to pay a $1.6\u00a0billion fine. [ 52 ] In 2010, the U.S. government agreed to a $92\u00a0million settlement with Gen Re, allowing the Berkshire Hathaway subsidiary to avoid prosecution in the AIG case. Gen Re also made a commitment to implement \"corporate governance concessions\", which required Berkshire Hathaway's chief financial officer to attend General Re's audit committee meetings and mandated the appointment of an independent director. [ 49 ] In 2002, Buffett entered in $11\u00a0billion worth of forward contracts to deliver U.S. dollars against other currencies. By April 2006, his total gain on these contracts was over $2\u00a0billion. Buffett announced in June 2006 that he would gradually give away 85% of his Berkshire holdings to five foundations in annual gifts of stock, starting in July 2006\u2014the largest contribution going to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation . [ 53 ] In 2007, in a letter to shareholders, Buffett announced that he was looking for a younger successor, or perhaps successors, to run his investment business. [ 54 ] 2007\u201308 financial crisis Buffett ran into criticism during the subprime mortgage crisis of 2007 and 2008, part of the Great Recession starting in 2007, that he had allocated capital too early resulting in suboptimal deals. [ 55 ] \"Buy American. I am.\" he wrote for an opinion piece published in the New York Times in 2008. [ 56 ] Buffett called the downturn in the financial sector that started in 2007 \" poetic justice \". [ 57 ] Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway suffered a 77% drop in earnings during Q3 2008 and several of his later deals suffered large mark-to-market losses. [ 58 ] On September 23, 2008, Berkshire Hathaway acquired 10 percent of perpetual preferred stock of Goldman Sachs . [ 59 ] Some of Buffett's put options (European exercise at expiry only) that he wrote (sold) were running at around $6.73\u00a0billion mark-to-market losses as of late 2008. [ 60 ] The scale of the potential loss prompted the SEC to demand that Berkshire produce, \"a more robust disclosure\" of factors used to value the contracts. [ 60 ] Buffett also helped Dow Chemical pay for its $18.8\u00a0billion takeover of Rohm & Haas . He thus became the single largest shareholder in the enlarged group with his Berkshire Hathaway, which provided $3\u00a0billion, underlining his instrumental role during the crisis in debt and equity markets. [ 61 ] In 2008, Buffett became the richest person in the world, garnering a total net worth estimated at $62\u00a0billion [ 62 ] by Forbes and at $58\u00a0billion [ 63 ] by Yahoo , dethroning Bill Gates , who had been number one on the Forbes list for 13 consecutive years. [ 64 ] In 2009, Gates regained the top position on the Forbes list, with Buffett shifted to second place. Both of the men's values dropped, to $40\u00a0billion and $37\u00a0billion respectively\u2014according to Forbes, Buffett lost $25\u00a0billion over a 12-month period during 2008/2009. [ 65 ] In October 2008, the media reported that Buffett had agreed to buy General Electric (GE) preferred stock. [ 66 ] The operation included special incentives: he received an option to buy three\u00a0billion shares of GE stock, at $22.25, over the five years following the agreement, and Buffett also received a 10% dividend (callable within three years). In February 2009, Buffett sold some Procter & Gamble Co. and Johnson & Johnson shares from his personal portfolio. [ 67 ] In addition to suggestions of mistiming, the wisdom in keeping some of Berkshire's major holdings, including The Coca-Cola Company, which in 1998 peaked at $86, raised questions. Buffett discussed the difficulties of knowing when to sell in the company's 2004 annual report: That may seem easy to do when one looks through an always-clean, rear-view mirror. Unfortunately, however, it's the windshield through which investors must peer, and that glass is invariably fogged. [ 68 ] In March 2009, Buffett said in a cable television interview that the economy had \"fallen off a cliff ... Not only has the economy slowed down a lot, but people have really changed their habits like I haven't seen\". Additionally, Buffett feared that inflation levels that occurred in the 1970s\u2014which led to years of painful stagflation \u2014might re-emerge. [ 69 ] [ 70 ] A capitalized Berkshire In 2009, Buffett invested $2.6\u00a0billion as a part of Swiss Re 's campaign to raise equity capital. [ 71 ] [ 72 ] Berkshire Hathaway already owned a 3% stake, with rights to own more than 20%. [ 73 ] Also in 2009, Buffett acquired Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp. for $34\u00a0billion in cash and stock. Alice Schroeder , author of Snowball , said that a key reason for the purchase was to diversify Berkshire Hathaway from the financial industry. [ 74 ] Measured by market capitalization in the Financial Times Global 500 , Berkshire Hathaway was the eighteenth largest corporation in the world as of June 2009. [ 75 ] In 2009, Buffett divested his failed investment in ConocoPhillips , saying to his Berkshire investors, I bought a large amount of ConocoPhillips stock when oil and gas prices were near their peak. I in no way anticipated the dramatic fall in energy prices that occurred in the last half of the year. I still believe the odds are good that oil sells far higher in the future than the current $40\u2013$50 price. But so far I have been dead wrong. Even if prices should rise, moreover, the terrible timing of my purchase has cost Berkshire several billion dollars. [ 76 ] The merger with the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway ( BNSF ) closed upon BNSF shareholder approval during Q1 of 2010. This deal was valued at approximately $44\u00a0billion (with $10 billion of outstanding BNSF debt) and represented an increase of the previously existing stake of 22%. [ 77 ] [ 78 ] In June 2010, Buffett defended the credit-rating agencies for their role in the US financial crisis, claiming: Very, very few people could appreciate the bubble . That's the nature of bubbles\u2014they're mass delusions. [ 79 ] On March 18, 2011, Goldman Sachs was given Federal Reserve approval to buy back Berkshire's preferred stock in Goldman. Buffett had been reluctant to give up the stock, which averaged $1.4\u00a0million in dividends per day, [ 80 ] [ 81 ] saying: I'm going to be the Osama bin Laden of capitalism. I'm on my way to an unknown destination in Asia where I'm going to look for a cave. If the U.S. Armed forces can't find Osama bin Laden in 10 years, let Goldman Sachs try to find me. [ 82 ] In November 2011, it was announced that over the course of the previous eight months, Buffett had bought 64\u00a0million shares of International Business Machine Corp (IBM) stock, worth around $11\u00a0billion. This unanticipated investment raised his stake in the company to around 5.5 percent\u2014the largest stake in IBM alongside that of State Street Global Advisors . Buffett had said on numerous prior occasions that he would not invest in technology because he did not fully understand it, so the move came as a surprise to many investors and observers. During the interview, in which he revealed the investment to the public, Buffett stated that he was impressed by the company's ability to retain corporate clients and said, \"I don't know of any large company that really has been as specific on what they intend to do and how they intend to do it as IBM\". [ 83 ] In May 2012, Buffett's acquisition of Media General, consisting of 63 newspapers in the south-eastern U.S., was announced. [ 84 ] The company was the second news print purchase made by Buffett in one year. [ 85 ] Interim publisher James W. Hopson announced on July 18, 2013, that the Press of Atlantic City would be sold to Buffett's BH Media Group by ABARTA, a private holding company based in Pittsburgh , U.S. At the Berkshire shareholders meeting in May 2013, Buffett explained that he did not expect to \"move the needle\" at Berkshire with newspaper acquisitions, but he anticipates an annual return of 10 percent. The Press of Atlantic City became Berkshire's 30th daily newspaper, following other purchases such as Virginia, U.S.' Roanoke Times and The Tulsa World in Oklahoma, U.S. [ 86 ] During a presentation to Georgetown University students in Washington, D.C. , in late September 2013, Buffett compared the U.S. Federal Reserve to a hedge fund and stated that the bank is generating \"$80\u00a0billion or $90\u00a0billion a year probably\" in revenue for the U.S. government. Buffett also advocated further on the issue of wealth equality in society: We have learned to turn out lots of goods and services, but we haven't learned as well how to have everybody share in the bounty. The obligation of a society as prosperous as ours is to figure out how nobody gets left too far behind. [ 87 ] After the difficulties of the economic crisis , Buffett managed to bring its company back to its pre-recession standards: in Q2 2014, Berkshire Hathaway made $6.4\u00a0billion in net profit, the most it had ever made in a three-month period. [ 88 ] On August 14, 2014, the price of Berkshire Hathaway's shares hit $200,000 a share for the first time, capitalizing the company at $328\u00a0billion. While Buffett had given away much of his stock to charities by this time, he still held 321,000 shares worth $64.2\u00a0billion. On August 20, 2014, Berkshire Hathaway was fined $896,000 for failing to report as required the December 9, 2013 purchase of shares in USG Corporation . [ 89 ] A 2023 ProPublica article based on a leak of confidential IRS data alleged that Buffett had made equity trades in his personal portfolio involving companies that Berkshire Hathaway bought or sold during the same quarter or the quarter before, raising concerns about conflicts of interest. On three dates between 2009 and 2012, Buffett sold shares of Johnson and Johnson, Walmart, and Wells Fargo, with the sales totaling $80 million in value. [ 90 ] [ 91 ] Although Buffett has not commented, Berkshire Hathaway's Vice Chairman Charlie Munger dismissed the allegations, saying \"I don\u2019t think there\u2019s the slightest chance that Warren Buffett is doing something that is deeply evil to make money for himself.\" [ 92 ] Investment philosophy Buffett's writings include his annual reports and various articles. Buffett is recognized by communicators [ 93 ] as a great story-teller, as evidenced by his annual letters to shareholders. He has warned about the pernicious effects of inflation: [ 94 ] The arithmetic makes it plain that inflation is a far more devastating tax than anything that has been enacted by our legislatures. The inflation tax has a fantastic ability to simply consume capital. It makes no difference to a widow with her savings in a 5 percent passbook account whether she pays 100 percent income tax on her interest income during a period of zero inflation, or pays no income taxes during years of 5 percent inflation. \u2014 Buffett, Fortune (1977) In his article, \" The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville \", Buffett rebutted the academic efficient-market hypothesis , that beating the S&P 500 was \"pure chance\", by highlighting the results achieved by a number of students of the Graham and Dodd value investing school of thought. In addition to himself, Buffett named Walter J. Schloss , Tom Knapp, Ed Anderson ( Tweedy, Browne LLC ), William J. Ruane ( Sequoia Fund ), Charlie Munger (Buffett's partner at Berkshire), Rick Guerin (Pacific Partners Ltd.), and Stan Perlmeter (Perlmeter Investments). [ 95 ] In his November 1999 Fortune article, he warned of investors' unrealistic expectations: [ 96 ] Let me summarize what I've been saying about the stock market: I think it's very hard to come up with a persuasive case that equities will over the next 17 years perform anything like\u2014anything like\u2014they've performed in the past 17. If I had to pick the most probable return, from appreciation and dividends combined, that investors in aggregate\u2014repeat, aggregate\u2014would earn in a world of constant interest rates, 2% inflation, and those ever hurtful frictional costs, it would be 6%! \u2014 Buffett, Fortune (1999) Index funds vis-\u00e0-vis active management See also: Jeffrey Tarrant \u00a7\u00a0Buffett bet Buffett has been a supporter of index funds for people who are either not interested in managing their own money or do not have the time. Buffett is skeptical that active management can outperform the market in the long run, and has advised both individual and institutional investors to move their money to low-cost index funds that track broad, diversified stock market indices. Buffett said in one of his letters to shareholders that \"when trillions of dollars are managed by Wall Streeters charging high fees, it will usually be the managers who reap outsized profits, not the clients\". [ 97 ] In 2007, Buffett made a bet with numerous managers that a simple S&P 500 index fund will outperform hedge funds that charge exorbitant fees. By 2017, the index fund was outperforming every hedge fund that made the bet against Buffett. [ 97 ] Using investment banks Buffet has a long-standing aversion to using the services of investment banks via Berkshire Hathaway. [ 98 ] This dynamic was also reported in Barron's , [ 99 ] Insider , [ 100 ] and Seeking Alpha , [ 101 ] among others. Personal life With Gary Green in 2010 In 1949, Buffett developed a crush on a young woman whose boyfriend had a ukulele . In an attempt to compete, he bought one of the instruments and has been playing it ever since. Though the attempt to capture her attention was unsuccessful, his music interest became a key part of his becoming a part of Susan Thompson 's life, and led to their marriage. Buffett often plays the instrument at stockholder meetings and other opportunities. His love of the instrument led to the commissioning of two custom Dairy Queen ukuleles by Dave Talsma, one of which was auctioned for charity. [ 102 ] In 1952, [ 103 ] Buffett married Susan at Dundee Presbyterian Church . The following year, they had their first child, Susan Alice . She was followed by Howard (b. 1954) and Peter (b. 1958). The couple began living separately in 1977, although they remained married until Susan's death in July 2004. Their only daughter Susan lives in Omaha, is a national board member of Girls, Inc. , and does charitable work through the Susan A. Buffett Foundation. [ 104 ] In 2006, on his 76th birthday, Buffett married his longtime companion, Astrid Menks, who was then 60 years old\u2014she had lived with him since his wife's departure to San Francisco in 1977. [ 105 ] [ 106 ] Susan had arranged for the two to meet before she left Omaha to pursue her singing career. All three were close and Christmas cards to friends were signed \"Warren, Susie and Astrid\". [ 107 ] Susan briefly discussed this relationship in an interview on the Charlie Rose Show shortly before her death, in a rare glimpse into Buffett's personal life. [ 108 ] Buffett disowned his son Peter's adopted daughter, Nicole, in 2006 after she participated in the Jamie Johnson documentary The One Percent about the growing economic inequality between the wealthy and the average citizen in the United States. Although his first wife referred to Nicole as one of her \"adored grandchildren\", [ 109 ] Buffett wrote Nicole a letter stating, \"I have not emotionally or legally adopted you as a grandchild, nor have the rest of my family adopted you as a niece or a cousin\". [ 110 ] [ 111 ] [ 112 ] By 2022, Buffett and she had reconciled. [ 113 ] [ 114 ] Buffett's home in Omaha, Nebraska His 2006 annual salary was about $100,000, which is small compared to senior executive remuneration in comparable companies. [ 115 ] In 2008, he earned a total compensation of $175,000, which included a base salary of just $100,000. [ 116 ] In 1958, Buffett purchased a five-bedroom stucco house in Omaha , where he still lives, for US$31,500 (equivalent to $352,658 in 2024). [ 117 ] [ 118 ] He also owned a vacation home in Laguna Beach, California , [ 119 ] which he purchased for $150,000 in 1971. He sold it for $7.5 million in 2018. [ 120 ] In 1989, after spending nearly $6.7\u00a0million of Berkshire's funds on a private jet , Buffett named it \"The Indefensible\", later renamed \"The Indispensable\". [ 121 ] This act was at odds with his past condemnation of extravagant spending by other CEOs. [ 122 ] Buffett sold the jet prior to mid-1999, and has since usually flown with Berkshire's flight services businesses. [ 123 ] Bridge is such a sensational game that I wouldn't mind being in jail if I had three cellmates who were decent players and who were willing to keep the game going twenty-four hours a day. \u2014Buffett on bridge [ 124 ] Buffett is an avid bridge player, which he plays with Gates [ 125 ] and champion player Sharon Osberg; he is said to spend 12 hours a week playing the game. [ 126 ] [ 127 ] In 2006, he sponsored a bridge match for the Buffett Cup . Modeled on the Ryder Cup in golf\u2014held immediately before it in the same city\u2014the teams are chosen by invitation, with a female team and five male teams provided by each country. [ 128 ] He is a dedicated, lifelong follower of Nebraska football , and attends as many games as his schedule permits. He supported the hire of Bo Pelini , following the 2007 season , stating, \"It was getting kind of desperate around here\". [ 129 ] He watched the 2009 game against Oklahoma from the Nebraska sideline, after being named an honorary assistant coach. [ 130 ] Buffett was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2009. [ 131 ] Buffett worked with Christopher Webber on an animated series called \" Secret Millionaires Club \" with chief Andy Heyward of DiC Entertainment . The series features Buffett and Munger and teaches children healthy financial habits. [ 132 ] [ 133 ] Buffett was raised as a Presbyterian , but has since described himself as agnostic . [ 134 ] In December 2006, it was reported that Buffett did not carry a mobile phone, did not have a computer at his desk, and drove his own automobile, [ 135 ] a Cadillac DTS . [ 136 ] In contrast to that, at the 2018 Berkshire Hathaway's shareholder meeting, he stated he uses Google as his preferred search engine. [ 137 ] In 2013 he had an old Nokia flip phone and had sent one email in his entire life. [ 138 ] In February 2020, Buffett revealed in a CNBC interview that he had traded in his flip phone for an iPhone 11 . [ 139 ] Buffett reads five newspapers every day, beginning with the Omaha World Herald , which his company acquired in 2011. Buffett's speeches are known for mixing business discussions with humor. Each year, Buffett presides over Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting in the Qwest Center in Omaha , Nebraska , an event drawing over 20,000 visitors from both the United States and abroad, giving it the nickname \"Woodstock of Capitalism\". Berkshire's annual reports and letters to shareholders, prepared by Buffett, frequently receive coverage by the financial media. Buffett's writings are known for containing quotations from sources as varied as the Bible and Mae West , [ 140 ] as well as advice in a folksy, Midwestern style and numerous jokes. In April 2017, Buffett (an avid Coca-Cola drinker and shareholder in the company) agreed to have his likeness placed on Cherry Coke products in China . Buffett was not compensated for this advertisement. [ 141 ] [ 142 ] Buffett is very distantly related to the 44th president of the United States, Barack Obama . [ 143 ] Buffett was a longtime friend of singer-songwriter Jimmy Buffett until Jimmy's death in September 2023, and they would often refer to one another as \"Uncle Warren\" and \"Cousin Jimmy\". The two took a DNA test which revealed no relation. [ 144 ] Health Buffett is a teetotaler . [ 145 ] On April 11, 2012, Buffett was diagnosed with stage I prostate cancer during a routine test. [ 146 ] He announced he would begin two months of daily radiation treatment from mid-July. In a letter to shareholders, Buffett said he felt \"great\u2014as if I were in my normal excellent health\u2014and my energy level is 100 percent\". [ 146 ] On September 15, 2012, Buffett announced that he had completed the full 44-day radiation treatment cycle, saying \"it's a great day for me\" and \"I am so glad to say that's over\". [ 147 ] Wealth and philanthropy Buffett, Kathy Ireland and Bill Gates at the 2015 Berkshire Hathaway shareholders meeting In 2008, Buffett was ranked by Forbes as the richest person in the world with an estimated net worth of approximately $62 billion . [ 148 ] In 2009, after donating billions of dollars to charity, he was ranked as the second richest man in the United States with a net worth of $37\u00a0billion [ 149 ] [ 150 ] with only Bill Gates ranked higher than Buffett. His net worth had risen to $58.5\u00a0billion as of September 2013. [ 151 ] In 1999, Buffett was named the Top Money Manager of the Twentieth Century in a survey by the Carson Group, ahead of Peter Lynch and John Templeton . [ 152 ] In 2007, he was listed among Time 's 100 Most Influential People in the world. [ 153 ] In 2011, President Barack Obama awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom . [ 154 ] Buffett, along with Bill Gates , was named the most influential global thinker in Foreign Policy ' s 2010 report. [ 155 ] Buffett has written several times of his belief that, in a market economy, the rich earn outsized rewards for their talents. [ 156 ] His children will not inherit a significant proportion of his wealth. He once commented, \"I want to give my kids just enough so that they would feel that they could do anything, but not so much that they would feel like doing nothing\". [ 157 ] Buffett had long stated his intention to give away his fortune to charity, and in June 2006, he announced a new plan to give 83% of it to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF). [ 158 ] He pledged about the equivalent of 10\u00a0million Berkshire Hathaway Class B shares to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (worth approximately $30.7\u00a0billion as of June 23, 2006), [ 159 ] making it the largest charitable donation in history, and Buffett one of the leaders of philanthrocapitalism . [ 160 ] The foundation will receive 5% of the total each July, beginning in 2006. The pledge is conditional upon three requirements: Bill or Melinda Gates must be alive and active in BMGF BMGF must continue to qualify as a charity Each year BMGF must give away an amount equal to the prior year's Berkshire gift plus the additional 5% of net assets as required of all US foundations Buffett joined the Gates Foundation's board, but did not plan to be actively involved in the foundation's investments. [ 161 ] [ 162 ] Buffett announced his resignation as a trustee of the Gates Foundation on June 23, 2021. [ 163 ] This represented a significant shift from Buffett's previous statements, to the effect that most of his fortune would pass to his Buffett Foundation . [ 164 ] The bulk of the estate of his wife, valued at $2.6\u00a0billion, went there when she died in 2004. [ 165 ] He also pledged $50\u00a0million to the Nuclear Threat Initiative , in Washington, where he began serving as an adviser in 2002. [ 166 ] In 2006, he auctioned his 2001 Lincoln Town Car [ 167 ] on eBay to raise money for Girls, Inc. [ 168 ] In 2007, he auctioned a luncheon with himself that raised a final bid of $650,100 for the Glide Foundation . [ 169 ] Later auctions raised $2.1\u00a0million, [ 170 ] [ 171 ] $1.7\u00a0million [ 172 ] and $3.5\u00a0million. The winners traditionally dine with Buffett at New York's Smith and Wollensky steak house . The restaurant donates at least $10,000 to Glide each year to host the meal. [ 173 ] In 2009, Ralph Nader wrote the book Only the Super Rich Can Save Us , a novel about \"a movement of billionaires led by Warren Buffett and featuring, among others, Ted Turner, George Soros and Barry Diller, who use their fortunes to clean up America\". On C-SPAN BookTV, Nader said Buffett invited him to breakfast after the book came out and was \"quite intrigued by the book\". He also told Nader of his plan to get \"billionaires all over the world to donate 50% of their estate to charity or good works\". [ 174 ] On December 9, 2010, Buffett, Bill Gates, and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg signed a promise they called the \"Gates-Buffett Giving Pledge \", in which they promise to donate to charity at least half of their wealth, and invite other wealthy people to follow suit. [ 10 ] [ 175 ] In 2018, after making almost $3.4\u00a0billion donations, [ 176 ] Buffett was ranked 3rd in the Forbes ' List of Billionaires 2018. [ 177 ] Buffett continues to help fund and support his family's individual foundations which include Susan Buffett 's Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation , Susan Alice Buffett 's Sherwood Foundation , Howard Graham Buffett 's Howard G. Buffett Foundation , and Peter Buffett 's NoVo Foundation . [ 178 ] [ 179 ] Warren Buffett was also supportive of his sister Doris Buffett 's Letters Foundation and Learning By Giving Foundation . [ 180 ] [ 181 ] In November 2022, Buffett made a donation of $750 million in Berkshire Hathaway shares to four charitable foundations run by his children. 1.5 million Class B shares of his conglomerate to the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, named after his first wife. He also transferred 300,000 Class B shares each to three funds managed by his children: the Sherwood Foundation, the Howard G. Buffett Foundation and the NoVo Foundation. [ 182 ] As of 2023 [update] , Buffett has given over $50 billion to charitable causes. [ 183 ] [ 184 ] Political and public policy views Buffett and President Obama in the Oval Office , July 14, 2010 In addition to political contributions over the years, Buffett endorsed and made campaign contributions to Barack Obama 's presidential campaign . On July 2, 2008, Buffett attended a $28,500 per plate fundraiser for Obama's campaign in Chicago. [ 185 ] Buffett intimated that John McCain 's views on social justice were so far from his own that McCain would need a \" lobotomy \" for Buffett to change his endorsement. [ 186 ] During the second 2008 U.S. presidential debate , McCain and Obama, after being asked first by presidential debate mediator Tom Brokaw , both mentioned Buffett as a possible future Secretary of the Treasury . [ 187 ] Later, in the third and final presidential debate, Obama mentioned Buffett as a potential economic advisor. [ 188 ] Buffett was also a financial advisor to Republican candidate Arnold Schwarzenegger during the 2003 California gubernatorial election . [ 189 ] On December 16, 2015, Buffett endorsed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton for president. [ 190 ] On August 1, 2016, Buffett challenged Donald Trump to release his tax returns. [ 191 ] [ 192 ] On October 10, 2016, after a reference to him in the second presidential debate , Buffett released his own tax return. [ 193 ] [ 194 ] He said he had paid $1.85\u00a0million in federal income taxes in 2015 on an adjusted gross income of $11.6\u00a0million, meaning he had an effective federal income tax rate of around 16 percent. Buffett also said he had made more than $2.8\u00a0billion worth of donations last year. [ 194 ] In response to Trump saying he was unable to release his tax information due to being under audit, Buffett said, \"I have been audited by the IRS multiple times and am currently being audited. I have no problem in releasing my tax information while under audit. Neither would Mr. Trump\u2014at least he would have no legal problem.\" [ 194 ] Buffett has said he would judge President Donald Trump by his results on national safety, economic growth and economic participation when deciding if he would vote for him in the 2020 presidential election . [ 195 ] [ 196 ] Health care Buffett described the health care reform under President Barack Obama as insufficient to deal with the costs of health care in the US, though he supports its aim of expanding health insurance coverage. [ 197 ] Buffett compared health care costs to a tapeworm , saying that they compromise US economic competitiveness by increasing manufacturing costs. [ 197 ] Buffett said in 2010 that it was not sustainable for the U.S. to devote 17% of its GDP to healthcare expenditure , noting that many other nations spent a much smaller proportion of their GDP on health expenditures, with better healthcare outcomes. [ 198 ] Buffett said, \"If you want the very best, I mean if you want to spend a million dollars to prolong your life 3 months in a coma or something then the US is probably the best\", but he also said that other countries spend much less and receive much more in health care value (visits, hospital beds, doctors and nurses per capita). [ 199 ] Buffett faults the incentives in the United States medical industry , that payers reimburse doctors for procedures ( fee-for-service ) leading to unnecessary care ( overutilization ), instead of paying for results. [ 200 ] He cited Atul Gawande 's 2009 article in the New Yorker [ 201 ] as a useful consideration of US health care, with its documentation of unwarranted variation in Medicare expenditures between McAllen, Texas and El Paso, Texas . [ 200 ] Buffett raised the problem of lobbying by the medical industry, saying that they are very focused on maintaining their income. [ 202 ] Curbing population growth Buffett has expressed concerns about unchecked population growth . In 2009, he met with several other billionaires to discuss healthcare, education and slowing population growth. Called \"The Good Club\" by an insider, the billionaires had given away $45 billion to philanthropic causes and included Oprah Winfrey , Michael Bloomberg and David Rockefeller, Jr. [ 203 ] The meeting has drawn criticism from some right-wing blogs, with some believing the group to be a part of a secret sterilization society. [ 204 ] Buffett is a long-time supporter of family planning. The Buffett Foundation has given over $1.5 billion to abortion research to include $427 million to Planned Parenthood . [ 205 ] Taxes See also: Buffett Rule President Obama announcing the \" Buffett Rule \" Buffett stated that he only paid 19% of his income for 2006 ($48.1\u00a0million) in total federal taxes (due to their source as dividends and capital gains) while his employees paid 33% of theirs, despite making much less money. [ 206 ] Regarding how little he pays in taxes compared to his employees, he said, \"How can this be fair? How can this be right? There's class warfare, all right, but it's my class, the rich class, that's making war, and we're winning.\" [ 207 ] [ 208 ] After Donald Trump accused him of taking \"massive deductions\", Buffett countered, \"I have copies of all 72 of my returns and none uses a carryforward .\" [ 209 ] Buffett favors the inheritance tax , saying that repealing it would be like \"choosing the 2020 Olympic team by picking the eldest sons of the gold-medal winners in the 2000 Olympics\". [ 210 ] In 2007, Buffett testified before the Senate and urged them to preserve the estate tax so as to avoid a plutocracy . [ 211 ] Some critics argued that Buffett (through Berkshire Hathaway) has a personal interest in the continuation of the estate tax, since Berkshire Hathaway benefited from the estate tax in past business dealings and had developed and marketed insurance policies to protect policy holders against future estate tax payments. [ 212 ] Buffett believes government should not be in the business of gambling, or legalizing casinos , calling it a tax on ignorance. [ 213 ] Dollar and gold The trade deficit induced Buffett to enter the foreign currency market for the first time in 2002. He substantially reduced his stake in 2005 as changing interest rates increased the costs of holding currency contracts. Buffett remained bearish on the dollar, stating that he was looking to acquire companies with substantial foreign revenues. Buffett has been critical of gold as an investment , with his critique being based primarily on its non-productive nature. In a 1998 address at Harvard, Buffett said: It gets dug out of the ground in Africa, or someplace. Then we melt it down, dig another hole, bury it again and pay people to stand around guarding it. It has no utility. Anyone watching from Mars would be scratching their head. In 1977, about stocks, gold, farmland and inflation, he stated: Stocks are probably still the best of all the poor alternatives in an era of inflation\u2014at least they are if you buy in at appropriate prices. [ 214 ] China Buffett invested in PetroChina Company Limited and in a rare move, posted a commentary [ 215 ] on Berkshire Hathaway's website stating why he would not divest over its connection with the Sudanese civil war that caused Harvard to divest. He sold this stake soon afterwards, sparing him the billions of dollars he would have lost had he held on to the company in the midst of the steep drop in oil prices beginning in the summer of 2008. In October 2008, Buffett invested $230\u00a0million for 10% of battery maker BYD Company ( SEHK : 1211 ), which runs a subsidiary of electric automobile manufacturer BYD Auto . In less than one year, the investment reaped over 500% return. [ 216 ] Tobacco During the RJR Nabisco , Inc., hostile takeover fight in 1987, Buffett was quoted as telling John Gutfreund : [ 217 ] I'll tell you why I like the cigarette business. It costs a penny to make. Sell it for a dollar. It's addictive. And there's fantastic brand loyalty . \u2014 Buffett, quoted in Barbarians at the Gate: The Fall of RJR Nabisco Speaking at Berkshire Hathaway Inc.'s 1994 annual meeting, Buffett said investments in tobacco are: [ 218 ] fraught with questions that relate to societal attitudes and those of the present administration. I would not like to have a significant percentage of my net worth invested in tobacco businesses. The economy of the business may be fine, but that doesn't mean it has a bright future. \u2014 Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting Coal In 2007, Buffett's PacifiCorp , a subsidiary of his MidAmerican Energy Company , canceled six proposed coal-fired power plants. These included Utah's Intermountain Power Project Unit 3, Jim Bridger Unit 5, and four proposed plants previously included in PacifiCorp's Integrated Resource Plan. The cancellations came in the wake of pressure from regulators and citizen groups. [ 219 ] Renewable energy Native American tribes and salmon fishermen sought to win support from Buffett for a proposal to remove four hydroelectric dams from the Klamath River owned by PacifiCorp which is a Berkshire Hathaway company. David Sokol responded on Buffett's behalf, stating that the FERC would decide the question. [ 220 ] [ 221 ] Expensing of stock options He has been a strong proponent of stock option expensing on corporate income statements . At the 2004 annual meeting, he lambasted a bill before the United States Congress that would consider only some company-issued stock options compensation as an expense, likening the bill to one that was almost passed by the Indiana House of Representatives to change the value of Pi from 3.14159 to 3.2 through legislative fiat. [ 222 ] When a company gives something of value to its employees in return for their services, it is clearly a compensation expense. And if expenses don't belong in the earnings statement, where in the world do they belong? [ 223 ] High technology In May 2012, Buffett said he had avoided buying stock in high-technology companies such as Facebook and Google due to them being complex and difficult to understand on top of their concomitant complications from being hard to confidently estimate their future value. He also stated that initial public offering 's (IPO) of new stock issues are almost always bad investments. Buffett has advised investors to look for companies that will have good value in ten years. [ 224 ] Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies In an interview with CNBC in January 2018, Buffett said the recent craze over Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies won't end well, adding that \"when it happens or how or anything else, I don't know;\" and later that year calling it, \"rat poison squared.\" But he also said he would not take a short position on bitcoin futures. [ 225 ] COVID-19 pandemic In a June 2021 interview with CNBC , Buffet said that the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has increased economic inequality and bemoaned that most people are unaware that \"hundreds of thousands or millions\" of small businesses have been negatively impacted. He also stated that the markets and the economy will likely be unpredictable well into the post-pandemic recovery period, even with the Biden administration and the United States Federal Reserve having a plan in place. He said the unpredictability and the effects of COVID-19 are far from over. [ 226 ] Film and television Aside from countless television appearances on various news programs ( Adam Smith 's Money World in 1985 reportedly being the first), [ 227 ] Buffett has appeared in numerous films and TV programs, both documentary, and fiction. Some film and television cameos he has made include Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps (2010), The Office (U.S.), All My Children , and Entourage (2015). [ 228 ] He has been a guest 10 times on Charlie Rose , and was the subject of the HBO documentary feature Becoming Warren Buffett (2017) and the BBC production The World's Greatest Money Maker (2009). Bibliography Buffett playing cards with Bill Gates at Borsheims during the 2018 shareholder's weekend Books about Buffett In October 2008, USA Today reported at least 47 books were in print with Buffett's name in the title. The article quoted the CEO of Borders Books , George Jones, as saying that the only other living persons named in as many book titles were U.S. presidents, world political figures and the Dalai Lama .

It turned out that Mr. Buffett, with immense income from dividends and capital gains, paid far, far less as a fraction of his income than the secretaries or the clerks or anyone else in his office. Further, in conversation it came up that Mr. Buffett doesn't use any tax planning at all. He just pays as the Internal Revenue Code requires. \"How can this be fair?\" he asked of how little he pays relative to his employees. \"How can this be right?\"  Even though I agreed with him, I warned that whenever someone tried to raise the issue, he or she was accused of fomenting class warfare.  \"There's class warfare, all right,\" Mr. Buffett said, \"but it's my class, the rich class, that's making war, and we're winning.\" ^ Zweifel, Dave (October 6, 2010). \"Plain Talk: There's class war, and rich are winning\" .

In Sunday night's presidential debate in St. Louis, Trump claimed that Buffett took a \"massive deduction\" while defending his claimed $916 million loss in 1995 that allowed him to avoid federal income tax in at least some years. Buffett, a supporter of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, said Monday that Trump \"has not seen my income tax returns.\"  \"I have paid federal income tax every year since 1944, when I was 13. (Though, being a slow starter, I owed only $7 in tax that year.)

Mr Buffett, who himself did not sign the petition because he thought it did not go far enough, said that repealing the estate tax would be a \"terrible mistake\". It was like \"choosing the 2020 Olympic team by picking the eldest sons of the gold-medal winners in the 2000 Olympics\".  Removing the tax would lead to the creation of an \"aristocracy of wealth\" instead of a meritocracy, he added. ^ Jim Snyder (November 15, 2007). \"Buffett tells Senate Finance panel 'dynastic' wealth on the rise in U.S.\" The Hill .

The 94-year-old \u201cOracle of Omaha,\u201d long known for his disinterest in tech stocks and electric vehicles, reportedly contacted Elon Musk directly to make the unprecedented offer. \u201cWhile I\u2019ve publicly maintained that I don\u2019t understand tech companies, I\u2019ve secretly been driving a Cybertruck around my Nebraska neighborhood at night,\u201d Buffett reportedly told investors on an early morning conference call on Tuesday, April 1. Here\u2019s more on the deal . Cash Deal Breaks Records The all-cash transaction represents the largest acquisition in business history. It\u2019s truly astounding in comparison to the previous record, which was Vodafone\u2019s $203 billion purchase of Mannesmann in 2000 . \u201cI\u2019ve been keeping the money in a shoebox under my bed,\u201d Buffett quipped when asked how Berkshire Hathaway could afford such an enormous purchase. Financial analysts are scrambling to make sense of the deal, particularly given Buffett\u2019s historical preference for companies with predictable cash flows and strong competitive advantages in stable industries. Buffett\u2019s Secret EV Passion During the call, Buffett shared that he\u2019s been a closet electric vehicle enthusiast for years, and that he owns a collection of every Tesla model ever made. \u201cI\u2019ve been telling people I still drive my old Cadillac, but the truth is I\u2019ve put 100,000 miles on my Model S,\u201d Buffett said. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing donuts in the Costco parking lot.\u201d The acquisition comes just days after Buffett mentioned in his annual shareholder letter that Berkshire Hathaway was \u201cstruggling to find attractive large acquisitions.\u201d Apparently, he found one. Musk To Stay On as \u2018Chief Meme Officer\u2019 Perhaps most surprising is that Elon Musk has agreed to remain with the company, taking on the newly created role of \u201cchief meme officer\u201d while Buffett will personally oversee day-to-day operations. \u201cWarren promised me I could still tweet whatever I want,\u201d Musk told reporters. \u201cPlus, he\u2019s giving me unlimited Cherry Coke and See\u2019s Candies. Have you tried those peanut brittle things? Love those little guys!\u201d APRIL FOOLS! This article is entirely satirical and was published on April 1, 2025.

OMAHA, Neb. -- Investor Warren Buffett renewed his Thanksgiving tradition of giving by handing out more than $1.1 billion of Berkshire Hathaway stock to four of his family's foundations Monday, and he offered new details about who will be handing out the rest of his fortune after his death. Buffett has said previously that his three kids will distribute his remaining $147.4 billion fortune in the 10 years after his death, but now he has also designated successors for them because it's possible that Buffett's children could die before giving it all away. He didn't identify the successors, but said his kids all know them and agree they would be good choices. \"Father time always wins. But he can be fickle - indeed unfair and even cruel - sometimes ending life at birth or soon thereafter while, at other times, waiting a century or so before paying a visit,\" the 94-year-old Buffett said in a letter to his fellow shareholders Monday. \"To date, I've been very lucky, but, before long, he will get around to me. There is, however, a downside to my good fortune in avoiding his notice. The expected life span of my children has materially diminished since the 2006 pledge. They are now 71, 69 and 66.\" Buffett said he still has no interest in creating dynastic wealth in his family - a view shared by his first and current wives. He acknowledged giving Howard, Peter and Susie millions over the years, but he has long said he believes \"hugely wealthy parents should leave their children enough so they can do anything but not enough that they can do nothing.\" The secret to building up such massive wealth over time has been the power of compounding interest and the steady growth of the Berkshire conglomerate Buffett leads through acquisitions and smart investments like buying billions of dollars of Apple shares as iPhone sales continued to drive growth in that company. Buffett never sold any of his Berkshire stock over the years and also resisted the trappings of wealth and never indulged in much - preferring instead to continue living in the same Omaha home he'd bought decades earlier and drive sensible luxury sedans about 20 blocks to work each day. \"As a family, we have had everything we needed or simply liked, but we have not sought enjoyment from the fact that others craved what we had,\" he said. If Buffett and his first wife had never given away any of their Berkshire shares, the family's fortune would be worth nearly $364 billion - easily making him the world's richest man - but Buffett said he had no regrets about his giving over the years. The family's giving began in earnest with the distribution of Susan Buffett's $3 billion estate after her death in 2004, but really took off when Warren Buffett announced plans in 2006 to make annual gifts to the foundations run by his kids along with the one he and his wife started, as well as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Warren Buffett's giving to date has favored the Gates Foundation with $55 billion in stock because his friend Bill Gates already had his foundation set up and could handle huge gifts when Buffett started giving away his fortune. But Buffett has said his kids now have enough experience in philanthropy to handle the task and he plans to cut off his Gates Foundation donations after his death. Buffett always makes his main annual gifts to all five foundations every summer, but for several years now he has been giving additional Berkshire shares to his family's foundations at Thanksgiving. Buffett reiterated Monday his advice to every parent to allow their families to read their will while they are still alive - like he has done - to make sure they have a chance to explain their decisions about how to distribute their belongings and answer their children's questions. Buffett said he and his longtime investing partner Charlie Munger, who died a year ago, \"saw many families driven apart after the posthumous dictates of the will left beneficiaries confused and sometimes angry.\" Today, Buffett continues to lead Berkshire Hathaway as chairman and CEO and has no plans to retire although he has handed over most of the day-to-day managing duties for the conglomerates dozens of companies to others. That allows him to focus on his favorite activity of deciding where to invest Berkshire's billions. One of Buffett's deputies who oversees all the noninsurance companies now, Greg Abel, is set to take over as CEO after Buffett's death. Even after converting 1,600 Class A shares into 2.4 million Class B Berkshire shares and giving them away, Buffett still owns 206,363 Class A shares and controls more than 30% of the vote.

Grogen | CNBC Warren Buffett turned 94 on Friday and his sprawling, one-of-a-kind conglomerate has never been worth more than it is today. Berkshire Hathaway became the first nontechnology company to top a $1 trillion market capitalization this week. Berkshire Class A shares also topped $700,000 apiece for the first time ever. Howard Marks, a great investor in his own right and friend of Buffett's, credits three things that have allowed the \"Oracle of Omaha\" to lead Berkshire to new heights, even at his advanced age. Watch NBC 4 free wherever you are WATCH HERE \"It's been a matter of a well-thought-out strategy prosecuted for seven decades with discipline, consistency and unusual insight,\" said Marks, co-founder and co-chairman of Oaktree Capital Management. \"Discipline and consistency are essential, but not sufficient. Without the unusual insight, he clearly wouldn't be the greatest investor in history.\" \"His record is a testament to the power of compounding at a very high rate for a very long period of time, uninterrupted. He never took a leave of absence,\" Marks added. Get Tri-state area news delivered to your inbox with NBC New York's News Headlines newsletter. SIGN UP In the midst of the go-go stock market of the 1960s , Buffett used an investment partnership he ran to buy what was then a failing New England textile company named Berkshire Hathaway. Today, his company is unrecognizable from what it once was, with businesses ranging from Geico insurance to BNSF Railway, an equity portfolio worth more than $300 billion and a monstrous $277 billion cash fortress. Eye-popping returns Money Report news 1 hour ago Stock futures tick higher ahead of Trump tariffs: Live updates news 1 hour ago Trump's tariffs are expected to raise consumer prices, but a key question remains: By how much? Generations of investors who study and imitate Buffett's investing style have been wowed by his shrewd moves for decades. The Coca-Cola bet from the late 1980s made a lesson for patient value investing in strong brands with wide moats. Injecting a lifeline investment in Goldman Sachs in the depth of the financial crisis showed an opportunistic side during crises. Going all in on Apple in recent years spoke to his flexibility at adopting his value approach to a new age. Buffett made headlines earlier this month by revealing he had dumped half of that Apple holding , ringing the bell a bit on an extremely lucrative trade. (While Apple is widely viewed as a growth stock, Buffett has long argued all investing is value investing \u2014 \"You are putting out some money now to get more later on.\") Decades of good returns snowballed and he has racked up an unparalleled track record. Berkshire shares have generated a 19.8% annualized gain from 1965 through 2023, nearly doubling the 10.2% return of the S&P 500. Cumulatively, the stock has gone up 4,384,748% since Buffett took over, compared with the S&P 500's 31,223% return. \"He's the most patient investor ever, which is a big reason for his success,\" said Steve Check, founder of Check Capital Management with Berkshire as its biggest holding. \"He can sit and sit and sit. Even at his age where there's not that much time left to sit, he'll still sit until he feels comfortable. I just think he'll just keep doing as best he can right to the end.\" Buffett remains chairman and CEO of Berkshire, although Greg Abel, vice chairman of Berkshire's noninsurance operations and Buffett's designated successor, has taken on many responsibilities at the conglomerate. Earlier this year, Buffett said Abel, 62, will make all investing decisions when he's gone. Buffett and Marks Oaktree's Marks said Buffett reinforced concepts that are integral to his own approach. Like Buffett, he is indifferent to macro forecasting and market timing; he seeks value relentlessly, while sticking to his own circle of competence. Courtesy David A. Grogan | CNBC Howard Marks, co-chairman, Oaktree Capital. \"He doesn't care about market timing and trading, but when other people get terrified, he marches in. We try to do the same thing,\" Marks said. Buffett, who at Columbia University studied under Benjamin Graham , has advised investors to view their stock holdings as small pieces of businesses. He believes volatility is a huge plus to the real investor as it offers an opportunity to take advantage of emotional selling. Oaktree, with $193 billion in assets under management, has grown into one of the biggest alternative investments players in the world, specializing in distressed lending and bargain-hunting. Marks, 78, has become a sharp, unequivocal contrarian voice in the investing world. His popular investment memos, which he started writing in 1990, are now viewed as required reading on Wall Street and even received a glowing endorsement from Buffett himself \u2014 \"When I see memos from\u00a0Howard Marks\u00a0in my mail, they're the first thing I open and read. I always learn something.\" The two were introduced in the aftermath of the Enron bankruptcy in the early 2000s. Marks revealed that Buffett ultimately motivated him to write his own book \u2014 \" The Most Important Thing: Uncommon Sense for the Thoughtful Investor \" \u2014 over a decade ahead of his own schedule. \"He was very generous with his comments. I don't think that book would have been written without his inspiration,\" Marks said. \"I had been planning to write a book when I retired. But with his encouragement, the book was published 13 years ago.\" Buffett's trajectory and his ability to enjoy what he does into his 90s also struck a chord with Marks. \"He says that he skips to work in the morning. He tackles investing with gusto and joy,\" Marks said. \"I still haven't retired, and I hope never to do so, following his example.\" Disillusioned crypto investors are struggling behind bitcoin's ETF success Wall Street analysts say buy the post-earnings dip in Nvidia shares Latest blow for Nike: Back-to-school shoe trends, Stifel says Berkshire Hathaway's new stock pick Ulta Beauty is a classic value play after a 30% sell-off Also on CNBC Stocks making the biggest moves premarket: CrowdStrike, Alibaba, Ulta Beauty With August about to wrap, Wall Street heads into a historically tough month The Fed\u2019s favorite inflation indicator increased 0.2% in July, as expected Subscribe to the CNBC YouTube Channel Morning Squawk Newsletter Copyright CNBC This article tagged under: news on now Live: News 4 New York @ 7pm Trending Stories Cory Booker WATCH LIVE: New Jersey Sen.

According to Forbes , as of 17 February 2025, Buffett's estimated net worth stood at US$149.6 billion, making him the seventh richest individual in the world. [ 3 ] Quick Facts Born, Education ...

The son of US congressman and businessman Howard Buffett , he developed an interest in business and investing during his youth. He entered the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1947 before graduating from the University of Nebraska at 20. He went on to graduate from Columbia Business School , where he molded his investment philosophy around the concept of value investing pioneered by Benjamin Graham . He attended New York Institute of Finance to focus on his economics background and soon pursued a business career. He later began various business ventures and investment partnerships, including one with Graham. He created Buffett Partnership Ltd. in 1956 and his investment firm eventually acquired a textile manufacturing firm, Berkshire Hathaway, assuming its name to create a diversified holding company . Buffett emerged as the company's chairman and majority shareholder in 1970. In 1978, fellow investor and long-time business associate Charlie Munger joined Buffett as vice-chairman. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Since 1970, Buffett has presided as the chairman and largest shareholder of Berkshire Hathaway, one of America's foremost holding companies and world's leading corporate conglomerates . He has been referred to as the \"Oracle\" or \"Sage\" of Omaha by global media as a result of having accumulated a massive fortune derived from his business and investment success. [ 6 ] [ 7 ] He is noted for his adherence to the principles of value investing, and his frugality despite his wealth. [ 8 ] Buffett has pledged to give away 99 percent [ 9 ] of his fortune to philanthropic causes, primarily via the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation . He founded the Giving Pledge in 2010 with Bill Gates , whereby billionaires pledge to give away at least half of their fortunes. [ 10 ] Early life and education Summarize Perspective Warren Edward Buffett was born on August 30, 1930, in Omaha, Nebraska , as the second of three children and the only son of Leila (n\u00e9e Stahl) and Congressman Howard Buffett . [ 11 ] He began his education at Rose Hill Elementary School. In 1942, his father was elected to the first of four terms in the United States Congress , and after moving with his family to Washington, D.C., Warren finished elementary school, attended Alice Deal Junior High School and graduated from what was then Woodrow Wilson High School in 1947, where his senior yearbook picture reads: \"likes math; a future stockbroker\". [ 12 ] After finishing high school and finding success with his side entrepreneurial and investment ventures, Buffett wanted to skip college to go directly into business but was overruled by his father. [ 13 ] [ 14 ] Buffett showcased an interest in business and investing at a young age. He was inspired by a book he borrowed from the Omaha public library at age seven, One Thousand Ways to Make $1000 . [ 15 ] Much of Buffett's early childhood years were enlivened with entrepreneurial ventures. In one of his first business ventures, Buffett sold chewing gum, Coca-Cola , and weekly magazines door to door . He worked in his grandfather's grocery store. While still in high school, he made money delivering newspapers, selling golf balls and stamps, and detailing cars, among other means. On his first income tax return in 1944, Buffett took a $35 deduction for the use of his bicycle and watch on his paper route. [ 16 ] In 1945, as a high school sophomore, Buffett and a friend spent $25 to purchase a used pinball machine, which they placed in the local barber shop . Within months, they owned several machines in three different barber shops across Omaha. They later sold the business to a war veteran for $1,200. [ 17 ] Investor Benjamin Graham was a major influential figure on the young Warren Buffett. Buffett's interest in the stock market and investing dated back to his schoolboy days spent in the customers' lounge of a regional stock brokerage near his father's own brokerage office. His father took interest in cultivating and educating the young Warren's curiosity surrounding the subject of business and investing, even at one point taking him to visit the New York Stock Exchange when he was 10. [ 18 ] At 11, he bought three shares of Cities Service Preferred for himself, and three for his sister Doris Buffett (who also became a philanthropist). [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] At 15, Warren made more than $175 monthly delivering Washington Post newspapers. In high school, he invested in a business owned by his father and bought a 40-acre farm worked by a tenant farmer. [ 22 ] He bought the land when he was 14 years old with $1,200 of his savings. [ 22 ] By the time he finished college, Buffett had amassed $9,800 in savings (about $ 130,000 today). [ 17 ] [ 23 ] In 1947, Buffett matriculated at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania . He would have preferred to focus on his business ventures, but enrolled due to pressure from his father. [ 17 ] Warren studied there for two years and joined the Alpha Sigma Phi fraternity. [ 24 ] He then transferred to the University of Nebraska where he graduated with a Bachelor of Science in business administration in 1951. [ 25 ] After being rejected by Harvard Business School in the spring of 1950, Buffett enrolled at Columbia Business School of Columbia University upon learning that Benjamin Graham taught there. He earned a Master of Science in economics from Columbia in 1951. [ 26 ] After graduating, Buffett attended the New York Institute of Finance . [ 27 ] The basic ideas of investing are to look at stocks as business, use the market's fluctuations to your advantage, and seek a margin of safety . That's what Ben Graham taught us. A hundred years from now they will still be the cornerstones of investing. [ 28 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] \u2014 Warren Buffett Business career Summarize Perspective Further information on Warren Buffett's time at Berkshire Hathaway: List of assets owned by Berkshire Hathaway Early business career Buffett worked from 1951 to 1954 at his father's firm, Buffett-Falk & Co., as an investment salesman; from 1954 to 1956 at Graham-Newman Corp. as a securities analyst; from 1956 to 1969 at several investment partnerships as the general partner; and from 1970 as chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc . In 1951, Buffett discovered that Graham was on the board of GEICO insurance. Taking a train to Washington, D.C., on a Saturday, he knocked on the door of GEICO's headquarters until a janitor admitted him. There he met Lorimer Davidson, GEICO's vice president, and the two discussed the insurance business for hours, and Buffett made his first purchase of GEICO stock. [ 31 ] Davidson would eventually become Buffett's lifelong friend and a lasting influence, [ 32 ] and would later recall that he found Buffett to be an \"extraordinary man\" after only fifteen minutes. Buffett wanted to work on Wall Street but both his father and Ben Graham urged him not to. He offered to work for Graham for free, but Graham refused. [ 33 ] Buffett returned to Omaha and worked as a stockbroker while taking a Dale Carnegie public speaking course. [ 34 ] Using what he learned, he felt confident enough to teach an \"Investment Principles\" night class at the University of Nebraska-Omaha . The average age of his students was more than twice his own. During this time he also purchased a Sinclair gas station as a side investment but it was unsuccessful. [ 35 ] In 1954, Buffett accepted a job at Benjamin Graham 's partnership. His starting salary was $12,000 a year (about $ 141,000 today). [ 23 ] There he worked closely with Walter Schloss . Graham was adamant that stock picks should provide a wide margin of safety after weighing the trade-off between their price and their intrinsic value. In 1956, Benjamin Graham retired and closed his partnership. At this time Buffett, who had amassed personal savings over $174,000 (about $ 2.01 million today) [ 23 ] , decided to return to Omaha, where he would quickly start a series of investment partnerships. In 1957, Buffett operated three investment partnerships. By 1959, the total had grown to six partnerships. That summer, Buffett was introduced to his future partner Charlie Munger during a business luncheon at The Omaha Club . [ 36 ] In 1961, Buffett revealed that 35% of the partnership's assets were invested in the Sanborn Map Company . He explained that Sanborn stock sold for only $45 per share in 1958, but the company's investment portfolio was worth $65 per share. This meant that Sanborn's map business was being valued at \"minus $20\". Buffett eventually purchased 23% of the company's outstanding shares as an activist investor , obtaining a seat for himself on the board of directors, and allied with other dissatisfied shareholders to control 44% of the shares. To avoid a proxy fight , the board offered to repurchase shares at fair value, paying with a portion of its investment portfolio. 77% of the outstanding shares were turned in. [ 37 ] [ 38 ] Buffett had reaped a 50 percent return on investment in just two years. [ 39 ] Assuming Berkshire In 1962, Buffett became a millionaire with the success of his partnerships, which by then had grown to 11 entities and held in excess of $7,178,500, of which over $1,025,000 belonged to Buffett. At the start of the year, he merged the various partnerships into the single entity Buffett Partnership, Ltd., which would be his primary investment vehicle for the remainder of the decade. [ 40 ] Buffett invested in and eventually took control of a textile manufacturing company, Berkshire Hathaway . He began buying shares in Berkshire from Seabury Stanton , the owner, whom he later fired. Buffett's partnerships began purchasing shares at $7.60 per share. In 1965, when Buffett's partnerships began purchasing Berkshire aggressively, they paid $14.86 per share while the company had working capital of $19 per share. This did not include the value of fixed assets (factory and equipment). Buffett took control of Berkshire Hathaway at a board meeting and named a new president, Ken Chace, to run the company. In 1966, Buffett closed the partnership to new money. He later claimed that the textile business had been his worst trade. [ 41 ] He then moved the business into the insurance sector, and, in 1985, the last of the mills that had been the core business of Berkshire Hathaway was sold. In a second letter, Buffett announced his first investment in a private business \u2014 Hochschild, Kohn and Co, a privately owned Baltimore department store. In 1967, Berkshire paid out its first and only dividend of 10 cents. [ 42 ] In 1969, Buffett liquidated the partnership and transferred their assets to his partners including shares of Berkshire Hathaway. He lived solely on his salary of $50,000 per year and his outside investment income. In 1973, Berkshire began to acquire stock in the Washington Post Company . Buffett became close friends with Katharine Graham , who controlled the company and its flagship newspaper and joined its board. In 1974, the SEC opened a formal investigation into Buffett and Berkshire's acquisition of Wesco Financial , due to possible conflict of interest. No charges were brought. In 1977, Berkshire indirectly purchased the Buffalo Evening News for $32.5 million. Antitrust charges started, instigated by its rival, the Buffalo Courier-Express . Both papers lost money until the Courier-Express folded in 1982. In 1979, Berkshire began to acquire stock in ABC . Capital Cities announced a $3.5 billion purchase of ABC on March 18, 1985, surprising the media industry, as ABC was four times bigger than Capital Cities at the time. Buffett helped finance the deal in return for a 25% stake in the combined company. [ 43 ] The newly merged company, known as Capital Cities/ABC (or CapCities/ABC), was forced to sell some stations due to Federal Communications Commission ownership rules. The two companies also owned several radio stations in the same markets. [ 44 ] In 1987, Berkshire Hathaway purchased a 12% stake in Salomon Inc., making it the largest shareholder and Buffett a director. In 1990, a scandal involving John Gutfreund (former CEO of Salomon Brothers ) surfaced. A rogue trader , Paul Mozer, was submitting bids in excess of what was allowed by Treasury rules. When this was brought to Gutfreund's attention, he did not immediately suspend the rogue trader. Gutfreund left the company in August 1991. [ 45 ] Buffett became chairman of Salomon until the crisis passed. [ 46 ] In 1988, Buffett began buying The Coca-Cola Company stock, eventually purchasing up to 7% of the company for $1.02 billion. [ 47 ] It would turn out to be one of Berkshire's most lucrative investments and one which it still holds. [ 48 ] As a billionaire In 1998 Buffett acquired General Re (Gen Re) as a subsidiary in a deal that presented difficulties \u2014 according to the Rational Walk investment website, \"underwriting standards proved to be inadequate\", while a \"problematic derivatives book\" was resolved after numerous years and a significant loss. [ 49 ] Gen Re later provided reinsurance after Buffett became involved with Maurice R. Greenberg at AIG in 2002. [ 50 ] With President Barack Obama at the White House in July 2011 During a 2005 investigation of an accounting fraud case involving AIG, Gen Re executives became implicated. On March 15, 2005, the AIG board forced Greenberg to resign from his post as chairman and CEO after New York state regulators claimed that AIG had engaged in questionable transactions and improper accounting. [ 51 ] On February 9, 2006, AIG agreed to pay a $1.6 billion fine. [ 52 ] In 2010, the U.S. government agreed to a $92 million settlement with Gen Re, allowing the Berkshire Hathaway subsidiary to avoid prosecution in the AIG case. Gen Re also made a commitment to implement \"corporate governance concessions\", which required Berkshire Hathaway's chief financial officer to attend General Re's audit committee meetings and mandated the appointment of an independent director. [ 49 ] In 2002, Buffett entered in $11 billion worth of forward contracts to deliver U.S. dollars against other currencies. By April 2006, his total gain on these contracts was over $2 billion. Buffett announced in June 2006 that he would gradually give away 85% of his Berkshire holdings to five foundations in annual gifts of stock, starting in July 2006\u2014the largest contribution going to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation . [ 53 ] In 2007, in a letter to shareholders, Buffett announced that he was looking for a younger successor, or perhaps successors, to run his investment business. [ 54 ] 2007\u201308 financial crisis Buffett ran into criticism during the subprime mortgage crisis of 2007 and 2008, part of the Great Recession starting in 2007, that he had allocated capital too early resulting in suboptimal deals. [ 55 ] \"Buy American. I am.\" he wrote for an opinion piece published in the New York Times in 2008. [ 56 ] Buffett called the downturn in the financial sector that started in 2007 \" poetic justice \". [ 57 ] Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway suffered a 77% drop in earnings during Q3 2008 and several of his later deals suffered large mark-to-market losses. [ 58 ] On September 23, 2008, Berkshire Hathaway acquired 10 percent of perpetual preferred stock of Goldman Sachs . [ 59 ] Some of Buffett's put options (European exercise at expiry only) that he wrote (sold) were running at around $6.73 billion mark-to-market losses as of late 2008. [ 60 ] The scale of the potential loss prompted the SEC to demand that Berkshire produce, \"a more robust disclosure\" of factors used to value the contracts. [ 60 ] Buffett also helped Dow Chemical pay for its $18.8 billion takeover of Rohm & Haas . He thus became the single largest shareholder in the enlarged group with his Berkshire Hathaway, which provided $3 billion, underlining his instrumental role during the crisis in debt and equity markets. [ 61 ] In 2008, Buffett became the richest person in the world, garnering a total net worth estimated at $62 billion [ 62 ] by Forbes and at $58 billion [ 63 ] by Yahoo , dethroning Bill Gates , who had been number one on the Forbes list for 13 consecutive years. [ 64 ] In 2009, Gates regained the top position on the Forbes list, with Buffett shifted to second place. Both of the men's values dropped, to $40 billion and $37 billion respectively\u2014according to Forbes, Buffett lost $25 billion over a 12-month period during 2008/2009. [ 65 ] In October 2008, the media reported that Buffett had agreed to buy General Electric (GE) preferred stock. [ 66 ] The operation included special incentives: he received an option to buy three billion shares of GE stock, at $22.25, over the five years following the agreement, and Buffett also received a 10% dividend (callable within three years). In February 2009, Buffett sold some Procter & Gamble Co. and Johnson & Johnson shares from his personal portfolio. [ 67 ] In addition to suggestions of mistiming, the wisdom in keeping some of Berkshire's major holdings, including The Coca-Cola Company, which in 1998 peaked at $86, raised questions. Buffett discussed the difficulties of knowing when to sell in the company's 2004 annual report: That may seem easy to do when one looks through an always-clean, rear-view mirror. Unfortunately, however, it's the windshield through which investors must peer, and that glass is invariably fogged. [ 68 ] In March 2009, Buffett said in a cable television interview that the economy had \"fallen off a cliff ... Not only has the economy slowed down a lot, but people have really changed their habits like I haven't seen\". Additionally, Buffett feared that inflation levels that occurred in the 1970s\u2014which led to years of painful stagflation \u2014might re-emerge. [ 69 ] [ 70 ] A capitalized Berkshire In 2009, Buffett invested $2.6 billion as a part of Swiss Re 's campaign to raise equity capital. [ 71 ] [ 72 ] Berkshire Hathaway already owned a 3% stake, with rights to own more than 20%. [ 73 ] Also in 2009, Buffett acquired Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp. for $34 billion in cash and stock. Alice Schroeder , author of Snowball , said that a key reason for the purchase was to diversify Berkshire Hathaway from the financial industry. [ 74 ] Measured by market capitalization in the Financial Times Global 500 , Berkshire Hathaway was the eighteenth largest corporation in the world as of June 2009. [ 75 ] In 2009, Buffett divested his failed investment in ConocoPhillips , saying to his Berkshire investors, I bought a large amount of ConocoPhillips stock when oil and gas prices were near their peak. I in no way anticipated the dramatic fall in energy prices that occurred in the last half of the year. I still believe the odds are good that oil sells far higher in the future than the current $40\u2013$50 price. But so far I have been dead wrong. Even if prices should rise, moreover, the terrible timing of my purchase has cost Berkshire several billion dollars. [ 76 ] The merger with the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway ( BNSF ) closed upon BNSF shareholder approval during Q1 of 2010. This deal was valued at approximately $44 billion (with $10 billion of outstanding BNSF debt) and represented an increase of the previously existing stake of 22%. [ 77 ] [ 78 ] In June 2010, Buffett defended the credit-rating agencies for their role in the US financial crisis, claiming: Very, very few people could appreciate the bubble . That's the nature of bubbles\u2014they're mass delusions. [ 79 ] On March 18, 2011, Goldman Sachs was given Federal Reserve approval to buy back Berkshire's preferred stock in Goldman. Buffett had been reluctant to give up the stock, which averaged $1.4 million in dividends per day, [ 80 ] [ 81 ] saying: I'm going to be the Osama bin Laden of capitalism. I'm on my way to an unknown destination in Asia where I'm going to look for a cave. If the U.S. Armed forces can't find Osama bin Laden in 10 years, let Goldman Sachs try to find me. [ 82 ] In November 2011, it was announced that over the course of the previous eight months, Buffett had bought 64 million shares of International Business Machine Corp (IBM) stock, worth around $11 billion. This unanticipated investment raised his stake in the company to around 5.5 percent\u2014the largest stake in IBM alongside that of State Street Global Advisors . Buffett had said on numerous prior occasions that he would not invest in technology because he did not fully understand it, so the move came as a surprise to many investors and observers. During the interview, in which he revealed the investment to the public, Buffett stated that he was impressed by the company's ability to retain corporate clients and said, \"I don't know of any large company that really has been as specific on what they intend to do and how they intend to do it as IBM\". [ 83 ] In May 2012, Buffett's acquisition of Media General, consisting of 63 newspapers in the south-eastern U.S., was announced. [ 84 ] The company was the second news print purchase made by Buffett in one year. [ 85 ] Interim publisher James W. Hopson announced on July 18, 2013, that the Press of Atlantic City would be sold to Buffett's BH Media Group by ABARTA, a private holding company based in Pittsburgh , U.S. At the Berkshire shareholders meeting in May 2013, Buffett explained that he did not expect to \"move the needle\" at Berkshire with newspaper acquisitions, but he anticipates an annual return of 10 percent. The Press of Atlantic City became Berkshire's 30th daily newspaper, following other purchases such as Virginia, U.S.' Roanoke Times and The Tulsa World in Oklahoma, U.S. [ 86 ] During a presentation to Georgetown University students in Washington, D.C. , in late September 2013, Buffett compared the U.S. Federal Reserve to a hedge fund and stated that the bank is generating \"$80 billion or $90 billion a year probably\" in revenue for the U.S. government. Buffett also advocated further on the issue of wealth equality in society: We have learned to turn out lots of goods and services, but we haven't learned as well how to have everybody share in the bounty. The obligation of a society as prosperous as ours is to figure out how nobody gets left too far behind. [ 87 ] After the difficulties of the economic crisis , Buffett managed to bring its company back to its pre-recession standards: in Q2 2014, Berkshire Hathaway made $6.4 billion in net profit, the most it had ever made in a three-month period. [ 88 ] On August 14, 2014, the price of Berkshire Hathaway's shares hit $200,000 a share for the first time, capitalizing the company at $328 billion. While Buffett had given away much of his stock to charities by this time, he still held 321,000 shares worth $64.2 billion. On August 20, 2014, Berkshire Hathaway was fined $896,000 for failing to report as required the December 9, 2013 purchase of shares in USG Corporation . [ 89 ] A 2023 ProPublica article based on a leak of confidential IRS data alleged that Buffett had made equity trades in his personal portfolio involving companies that Berkshire Hathaway bought or sold during the same quarter or the quarter before, raising concerns about conflicts of interest. On three dates between 2009 and 2012, Buffett sold shares of Johnson and Johnson, Walmart, and Wells Fargo, with the sales totaling $80 million in value. [ 90 ] [ 91 ] Although Buffett has not commented, Berkshire Hathaway's Vice Chairman Charlie Munger dismissed the allegations, saying \"I don\u2019t think there\u2019s the slightest chance that Warren Buffett is doing something that is deeply evil to make money for himself.\" [ 92 ] Investment philosophy Summarize Perspective Buffett's writings include his annual reports and various articles. Buffett is recognized by communicators [ 93 ] as a great story-teller, as evidenced by his annual letters to shareholders. He has warned about the pernicious effects of inflation: [ 94 ] The arithmetic makes it plain that inflation is a far more devastating tax than anything that has been enacted by our legislatures. The inflation tax has a fantastic ability to simply consume capital. It makes no difference to a widow with her savings in a 5 percent passbook account whether she pays 100 percent income tax on her interest income during a period of zero inflation, or pays no income taxes during years of 5 percent inflation. \u2014 Buffett, Fortune (1977) In his article, \" The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville \", Buffett rebutted the academic efficient-market hypothesis , that beating the S&P 500 was \"pure chance\", by highlighting the results achieved by a number of students of the Graham and Dodd value investing school of thought. In addition to himself, Buffett named Walter J. Schloss , Tom Knapp, Ed Anderson ( Tweedy, Browne LLC ), William J. Ruane ( Sequoia Fund ), Charlie Munger (Buffett's partner at Berkshire), Rick Guerin (Pacific Partners Ltd.), and Stan Perlmeter (Perlmeter Investments). [ 95 ] In his November 1999 Fortune article, he warned of investors' unrealistic expectations: [ 96 ] Let me summarize what I've been saying about the stock market: I think it's very hard to come up with a persuasive case that equities will over the next 17 years perform anything like\u2014anything like\u2014they've performed in the past 17. If I had to pick the most probable return, from appreciation and dividends combined, that investors in aggregate\u2014repeat, aggregate\u2014would earn in a world of constant interest rates, 2% inflation, and those ever hurtful frictional costs, it would be 6%! \u2014 Buffett, Fortune (1999) Index funds vis-\u00e0-vis active management See also: Jeffrey Tarrant \u00a7 Buffett bet Buffett has been a supporter of index funds for people who are either not interested in managing their own money or do not have the time. Buffett is skeptical that active management can outperform the market in the long run, and has advised both individual and institutional investors to move their money to low-cost index funds that track broad, diversified stock market indices. Buffett said in one of his letters to shareholders that \"when trillions of dollars are managed by Wall Streeters charging high fees, it will usually be the managers who reap outsized profits, not the clients\". [ 97 ] In 2007, Buffett made a bet with numerous managers that a simple S&P 500 index fund will outperform hedge funds that charge exorbitant fees. By 2017, the index fund was outperforming every hedge fund that made the bet against Buffett. [ 97 ] Using investment banks Buffet has a long-standing aversion to using the services of investment banks via Berkshire Hathaway. [ 98 ] This dynamic was also reported in Barron's , [ 99 ] Insider , [ 100 ] and Seeking Alpha , [ 101 ] among others. Personal life Summarize Perspective With Gary Green in 2010 In 1949, Buffett developed a crush on a young woman whose boyfriend had a ukulele . In an attempt to compete, he bought one of the instruments and has been playing it ever since. Though the attempt to capture her attention was unsuccessful, his music interest became a key part of his becoming a part of Susan Thompson 's life, and led to their marriage. Buffett often plays the instrument at stockholder meetings and other opportunities. His love of the instrument led to the commissioning of two custom Dairy Queen ukuleles by Dave Talsma, one of which was auctioned for charity. [ 102 ] In 1952, [ 103 ] Buffett married Susan at Dundee Presbyterian Church . The following year, they had their first child, Susan Alice . She was followed by Howard (b. 1954) and Peter (b. 1958). The couple began living separately in 1977, although they remained married until Susan's death in July 2004. Their only daughter Susan lives in Omaha, is a national board member of Girls, Inc. , and does charitable work through the Susan A. Buffett Foundation. [ 104 ] In 2006, on his 76th birthday, Buffett married his longtime companion, Astrid Menks, who was then 60 years old\u2014she had lived with him since his wife's departure to San Francisco in 1977. [ 105 ] [ 106 ] Susan had arranged for the two to meet before she left Omaha to pursue her singing career. All three were close and Christmas cards to friends were signed \"Warren, Susie and Astrid\". [ 107 ] Susan briefly discussed this relationship in an interview on the Charlie Rose Show shortly before her death, in a rare glimpse into Buffett's personal life. [ 108 ] Buffett disowned his son Peter's adopted daughter, Nicole, in 2006 after she participated in the Jamie Johnson documentary The One Percent about the growing economic inequality between the wealthy and the average citizen in the United States. Although his first wife referred to Nicole as one of her \"adored grandchildren\", [ 109 ] Buffett wrote Nicole a letter stating, \"I have not emotionally or legally adopted you as a grandchild, nor have the rest of my family adopted you as a niece or a cousin\". [ 110 ] [ 111 ] [ 112 ] By 2022, Buffett and she had reconciled. [ 113 ] [ 114 ] Buffett's home in Omaha, Nebraska His 2006 annual salary was about $100,000, which is small compared to senior executive remuneration in comparable companies. [ 115 ] In 2008, he earned a total compensation of $175,000, which included a base salary of just $100,000. [ 116 ] In 1958, Buffett purchased a five-bedroom stucco house in Omaha , where he still lives, for US$31,500 (equivalent to $352,658 in 2024) . [ 117 ] [ 118 ] He also owned a vacation home in Laguna Beach, California , [ 119 ] which he purchased for $150,000 in 1971. He sold it for $7.5 million in 2018. [ 120 ] In 1989, after spending nearly $6.7 million of Berkshire's funds on a private jet , Buffett named it \"The Indefensible\", later renamed \"The Indispensable\". [ 121 ] This act was at odds with his past condemnation of extravagant spending by other CEOs. [ 122 ] Buffett sold the jet prior to mid-1999, and has since usually flown with Berkshire's flight services businesses. [ 123 ] Bridge is such a sensational game that I wouldn't mind being in jail if I had three cellmates who were decent players and who were willing to keep the game going twenty-four hours a day. \u2014Buffett on bridge [ 124 ] Buffett is an avid bridge player, which he plays with Gates [ 125 ] and champion player Sharon Osberg; he is said to spend 12 hours a week playing the game. [ 126 ] [ 127 ] In 2006, he sponsored a bridge match for the Buffett Cup . Modeled on the Ryder Cup in golf\u2014held immediately before it in the same city\u2014the teams are chosen by invitation, with a female team and five male teams provided by each country. [ 128 ] He is a dedicated, lifelong follower of Nebraska football , and attends as many games as his schedule permits. He supported the hire of Bo Pelini , following the 2007 season , stating, \"It was getting kind of desperate around here\". [ 129 ] He watched the 2009 game against Oklahoma from the Nebraska sideline, after being named an honorary assistant coach. [ 130 ] Buffett was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2009. [ 131 ] Buffett worked with Christopher Webber on an animated series called \" Secret Millionaires Club \" with chief Andy Heyward of DiC Entertainment . The series features Buffett and Munger and teaches children healthy financial habits. [ 132 ] [ 133 ] Buffett was raised as a Presbyterian , but has since described himself as agnostic . [ 134 ] In December 2006, it was reported that Buffett did not carry a mobile phone, did not have a computer at his desk, and drove his own automobile, [ 135 ] a Cadillac DTS . [ 136 ] In contrast to that, at the 2018 Berkshire Hathaway's shareholder meeting, he stated he uses Google as his preferred search engine. [ 137 ] In 2013 he had an old Nokia flip phone and had sent one email in his entire life. [ 138 ] In February 2020, Buffett revealed in a CNBC interview that he had traded in his flip phone for an iPhone 11 . [ 139 ] Buffett reads five newspapers every day, beginning with the Omaha World Herald , which his company acquired in 2011. Buffett's speeches are known for mixing business discussions with humor. Each year, Buffett presides over Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting in the Qwest Center in Omaha , Nebraska , an event drawing over 20,000 visitors from both the United States and abroad, giving it the nickname \"Woodstock of Capitalism\". Berkshire's annual reports and letters to shareholders, prepared by Buffett, frequently receive coverage by the financial media. Buffett's writings are known for containing quotations from sources as varied as the Bible and Mae West , [ 140 ] as well as advice in a folksy, Midwestern style and numerous jokes. In April 2017, Buffett (an avid Coca-Cola drinker and shareholder in the company) agreed to have his likeness placed on Cherry Coke products in China . Buffett was not compensated for this advertisement. [ 141 ] [ 142 ] Buffett is very distantly related to the 44th president of the United States, Barack Obama . [ 143 ] Buffett was a longtime friend of singer-songwriter Jimmy Buffett until Jimmy's death in September 2023, and they would often refer to one another as \"Uncle Warren\" and \"Cousin Jimmy\". The two took a DNA test which revealed no relation. [ 144 ] Health Buffett is a teetotaler . [ 145 ] On April 11, 2012, Buffett was diagnosed with stage I prostate cancer during a routine test. [ 146 ] He announced he would begin two months of daily radiation treatment from mid-July. In a letter to shareholders, Buffett said he felt \"great\u2014as if I were in my normal excellent health\u2014and my energy level is 100 percent\". [ 146 ] On September 15, 2012, Buffett announced that he had completed the full 44-day radiation treatment cycle, saying \"it's a great day for me\" and \"I am so glad to say that's over\". [ 147 ] Wealth and philanthropy Summarize Perspective Buffett, Kathy Ireland and Bill Gates at the 2015 Berkshire Hathaway shareholders meeting In 2008, Buffett was ranked by Forbes as the richest person in the world with an estimated net worth of approximately $62 billion . [ 148 ] In 2009, after donating billions of dollars to charity, he was ranked as the second richest man in the United States with a net worth of $37 billion [ 149 ] [ 150 ] with only Bill Gates ranked higher than Buffett. His net worth had risen to $58.5 billion as of September 2013. [ 151 ] In 1999, Buffett was named the Top Money Manager of the Twentieth Century in a survey by the Carson Group, ahead of Peter Lynch and John Templeton . [ 152 ] In 2007, he was listed among Time ' s 100 Most Influential People in the world. [ 153 ] In 2011, President Barack Obama awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom . [ 154 ] Buffett, along with Bill Gates , was named the most influential global thinker in Foreign Policy ' s 2010 report. [ 155 ] Buffett has written several times of his belief that, in a market economy, the rich earn outsized rewards for their talents. [ 156 ] His children will not inherit a significant proportion of his wealth. He once commented, \"I want to give my kids just enough so that they would feel that they could do anything, but not so much that they would feel like doing nothing\". [ 157 ] Buffett had long stated his intention to give away his fortune to charity, and in June 2006, he announced a new plan to give 83% of it to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF). [ 158 ] He pledged about the equivalent of 10 million Berkshire Hathaway Class B shares to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (worth approximately $30.7 billion as of June 23, 2006), [ 159 ] making it the largest charitable donation in history, and Buffett one of the leaders of philanthrocapitalism . [ 160 ] The foundation will receive 5% of the total each July, beginning in 2006. The pledge is conditional upon three requirements: Bill or Melinda Gates must be alive and active in BMGF BMGF must continue to qualify as a charity Each year BMGF must give away an amount equal to the prior year's Berkshire gift plus the additional 5% of net assets as required of all US foundations Buffett joined the Gates Foundation's board, but did not plan to be actively involved in the foundation's investments. [ 161 ] [ 162 ] Buffett announced his resignation as a trustee of the Gates Foundation on June 23, 2021. [ 163 ] This represented a significant shift from Buffett's previous statements, to the effect that most of his fortune would pass to his Buffett Foundation . [ 164 ] The bulk of the estate of his wife, valued at $2.6 billion, went there when she died in 2004. [ 165 ] He also pledged $50 million to the Nuclear Threat Initiative , in Washington, where he began serving as an adviser in 2002. [ 166 ] In 2006, he auctioned his 2001 Lincoln Town Car [ 167 ] on eBay to raise money for Girls, Inc. [ 168 ] In 2007, he auctioned a luncheon with himself that raised a final bid of $650,100 for the Glide Foundation . [ 169 ] Later auctions raised $2.1 million, [ 170 ] [ 171 ] $1.7 million [ 172 ] and $3.5 million. The winners traditionally dine with Buffett at New York's Smith and Wollensky steak house . The restaurant donates at least $10,000 to Glide each year to host the meal. [ 173 ] In 2009, Ralph Nader wrote the book Only the Super Rich Can Save Us , a novel about \"a movement of billionaires led by Warren Buffett and featuring, among others, Ted Turner, George Soros and Barry Diller, who use their fortunes to clean up America\". On C-SPAN BookTV, Nader said Buffett invited him to breakfast after the book came out and was \"quite intrigued by the book\". He also told Nader of his plan to get \"billionaires all over the world to donate 50% of their estate to charity or good works\". [ 174 ] On December 9, 2010, Buffett, Bill Gates, and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg signed a promise they called the \"Gates-Buffett Giving Pledge \", in which they promise to donate to charity at least half of their wealth, and invite other wealthy people to follow suit. [ 10 ] [ 175 ] In 2018, after making almost $3.4 billion donations, [ 176 ] Buffett was ranked 3rd in the Forbes ' List of Billionaires 2018. [ 177 ] Buffett continues to help fund and support his family's individual foundations which include Susan Buffett 's Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation , Susan Alice Buffett 's Sherwood Foundation , Howard Graham Buffett 's Howard G. Buffett Foundation , and Peter Buffett 's NoVo Foundation . [ 178 ] [ 179 ] Warren Buffett was also supportive of his sister Doris Buffett 's Letters Foundation and Learning By Giving Foundation . [ 180 ] [ 181 ] In November 2022, Buffett made a donation of $750 million in Berkshire Hathaway shares to four charitable foundations run by his children. 1.5 million Class B shares of his conglomerate to the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, named after his first wife. He also transferred 300,000 Class B shares each to three funds managed by his children: the Sherwood Foundation, the Howard G. Buffett Foundation and the NoVo Foundation. [ 182 ] As of 2023 [ update ] , Buffett has given over $50 billion to charitable causes. [ 183 ] [ 184 ] Political and public policy views Summarize Perspective Buffett and President Obama in the Oval Office , July 14, 2010 In addition to political contributions over the years, Buffett endorsed and made campaign contributions to Barack Obama 's presidential campaign . On July 2, 2008, Buffett attended a $28,500 per plate fundraiser for Obama's campaign in Chicago. [ 185 ] Buffett intimated that John McCain 's views on social justice were so far from his own that McCain would need a \" lobotomy \" for Buffett to change his endorsement. [ 186 ] During the second 2008 U.S. presidential debate , McCain and Obama, after being asked first by presidential debate mediator Tom Brokaw , both mentioned Buffett as a possible future Secretary of the Treasury . [ 187 ] Later, in the third and final presidential debate, Obama mentioned Buffett as a potential economic advisor. [ 188 ] Buffett was also a financial advisor to Republican candidate Arnold Schwarzenegger during the 2003 California gubernatorial election . [ 189 ] On December 16, 2015, Buffett endorsed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton for president. [ 190 ] On August 1, 2016, Buffett challenged Donald Trump to release his tax returns. [ 191 ] [ 192 ] On October 10, 2016, after a reference to him in the second presidential debate , Buffett released his own tax return. [ 193 ] [ 194 ] He said he had paid $1.85 million in federal income taxes in 2015 on an adjusted gross income of $11.6 million, meaning he had an effective federal income tax rate of around 16 percent. Buffett also said he had made more than $2.8 billion worth of donations last year. [ 194 ] In response to Trump saying he was unable to release his tax information due to being under audit, Buffett said, \"I have been audited by the IRS multiple times and am currently being audited. I have no problem in releasing my tax information while under audit. Neither would Mr. Trump\u2014at least he would have no legal problem.\" [ 194 ] Buffett has said he would judge President Donald Trump by his results on national safety, economic growth and economic participation when deciding if he would vote for him in the 2020 presidential election . [ 195 ] [ 196 ] Health care Buffett described the health care reform under President Barack Obama as insufficient to deal with the costs of health care in the US, though he supports its aim of expanding health insurance coverage. [ 197 ] Buffett compared health care costs to a tapeworm , saying that they compromise US economic competitiveness by increasing manufacturing costs. [ 197 ] Buffett said in 2010 that it was not sustainable for the U.S. to devote 17% of its GDP to healthcare expenditure , noting that many other nations spent a much smaller proportion of their GDP on health expenditures, with better healthcare outcomes. [ 198 ] Buffett said, \"If you want the very best, I mean if you want to spend a million dollars to prolong your life 3 months in a coma or something then the US is probably the best\", but he also said that other countries spend much less and receive much more in health care value (visits, hospital beds, doctors and nurses per capita). [ 199 ] Buffett faults the incentives in the United States medical industry , that payers reimburse doctors for procedures ( fee-for-service ) leading to unnecessary care ( overutilization ), instead of paying for results. [ 200 ] He cited Atul Gawande 's 2009 article in the New Yorker [ 201 ] as a useful consideration of US health care, with its documentation of unwarranted variation in Medicare expenditures between McAllen, Texas and El Paso, Texas . [ 200 ] Buffett raised the problem of lobbying by the medical industry, saying that they are very focused on maintaining their income. [ 202 ] Curbing population growth Buffett has expressed concerns about unchecked population growth . In 2009, he met with several other billionaires to discuss healthcare, education and slowing population growth. Called \"The Good Club\" by an insider, the billionaires had given away $45 billion to philanthropic causes and included Oprah Winfrey , Michael Bloomberg and David Rockefeller, Jr. [ 203 ] The meeting has drawn criticism from some right-wing blogs, with some believing the group to be a part of a secret sterilization society. [ 204 ] Buffett is a long-time supporter of family planning. The Buffett Foundation has given over $1.5 billion to abortion research to include $427 million to Planned Parenthood . [ 205 ] Taxes See also: Buffett Rule President Obama announcing the \" Buffett Rule \" Buffett stated that he only paid 19% of his income for 2006 ($48.1 million) in total federal taxes (due to their source as dividends and capital gains) while his employees paid 33% of theirs, despite making much less money. [ 206 ] Regarding how little he pays in taxes compared to his employees, he said, \"How can this be fair? How can this be right? There's class warfare, all right, but it's my class, the rich class, that's making war, and we're winning.\" [ 207 ] [ 208 ] After Donald Trump accused him of taking \"massive deductions\", Buffett countered, \"I have copies of all 72 of my returns and none uses a carryforward .\" [ 209 ] Buffett favors the inheritance tax , saying that repealing it would be like \"choosing the 2020 Olympic team by picking the eldest sons of the gold-medal winners in the 2000 Olympics\". [ 210 ] In 2007, Buffett testified before the Senate and urged them to preserve the estate tax so as to avoid a plutocracy . [ 211 ] Some critics argued that Buffett (through Berkshire Hathaway) has a personal interest in the continuation of the estate tax, since Berkshire Hathaway benefited from the estate tax in past business dealings and had developed and marketed insurance policies to protect policy holders against future estate tax payments. [ 212 ] Buffett believes government should not be in the business of gambling, or legalizing casinos , calling it a tax on ignorance. [ 213 ] Dollar and gold The trade deficit induced Buffett to enter the foreign currency market for the first time in 2002. He substantially reduced his stake in 2005 as changing interest rates increased the costs of holding currency contracts. Buffett remained bearish on the dollar, stating that he was looking to acquire companies with substantial foreign revenues. Buffett has been critical of gold as an investment , with his critique being based primarily on its non-productive nature. In a 1998 address at Harvard, Buffett said: It gets dug out of the ground in Africa, or someplace. Then we melt it down, dig another hole, bury it again and pay people to stand around guarding it. It has no utility. Anyone watching from Mars would be scratching their head. In 1977, about stocks, gold, farmland and inflation, he stated: Stocks are probably still the best of all the poor alternatives in an era of inflation\u2014at least they are if you buy in at appropriate prices. [ 214 ] China Buffett invested in PetroChina Company Limited and in a rare move, posted a commentary [ 215 ] on Berkshire Hathaway's website stating why he would not divest over its connection with the Sudanese civil war that caused Harvard to divest. He sold this stake soon afterwards, sparing him the billions of dollars he would have lost had he held on to the company in the midst of the steep drop in oil prices beginning in the summer of 2008. In October 2008, Buffett invested $230 million for 10% of battery maker BYD Company ( SEHK : 1211 ), which runs a subsidiary of electric automobile manufacturer BYD Auto . In less than one year, the investment reaped over 500% return. [ 216 ] Tobacco During the RJR Nabisco , Inc., hostile takeover fight in 1987, Buffett was quoted as telling John Gutfreund : [ 217 ] I'll tell you why I like the cigarette business. It costs a penny to make. Sell it for a dollar. It's addictive. And there's fantastic brand loyalty . \u2014 Buffett, quoted in Barbarians at the Gate: The Fall of RJR Nabisco Speaking at Berkshire Hathaway Inc.'s 1994 annual meeting, Buffett said investments in tobacco are: [ 218 ] fraught with questions that relate to societal attitudes and those of the present administration. I would not like to have a significant percentage of my net worth invested in tobacco businesses. The economy of the business may be fine, but that doesn't mean it has a bright future. \u2014 Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting Coal In 2007, Buffett's PacifiCorp , a subsidiary of his MidAmerican Energy Company , canceled six proposed coal-fired power plants. These included Utah's Intermountain Power Project Unit 3, Jim Bridger Unit 5, and four proposed plants previously included in PacifiCorp's Integrated Resource Plan. The cancellations came in the wake of pressure from regulators and citizen groups. [ 219 ] Renewable energy Native American tribes and salmon fishermen sought to win support from Buffett for a proposal to remove four hydroelectric dams from the Klamath River owned by PacifiCorp which is a Berkshire Hathaway company. David Sokol responded on Buffett's behalf, stating that the FERC would decide the question. [ 220 ] [ 221 ] Expensing of stock options He has been a strong proponent of stock option expensing on corporate income statements . At the 2004 annual meeting, he lambasted a bill before the United States Congress that would consider only some company-issued stock options compensation as an expense, likening the bill to one that was almost passed by the Indiana House of Representatives to change the value of Pi from 3.14159 to 3.2 through legislative fiat. [ 222 ] When a company gives something of value to its employees in return for their services, it is clearly a compensation expense. And if expenses don't belong in the earnings statement, where in the world do they belong? [ 223 ] High technology In May 2012, Buffett said he had avoided buying stock in high-technology companies such as Facebook and Google due to them being complex and difficult to understand on top of their concomitant complications from being hard to confidently estimate their future value. He also stated that initial public offering 's (IPO) of new stock issues are almost always bad investments. Buffett has advised investors to look for companies that will have good value in ten years. [ 224 ] Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies In an interview with CNBC in January 2018, Buffett said the recent craze over Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies won't end well, adding that \"when it happens or how or anything else, I don't know;\" and later that year calling it, \"rat poison squared.\" But he also said he would not take a short position on bitcoin futures. [ 225 ] COVID-19 pandemic In a June 2021 interview with CNBC , Buffet said that the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has increased economic inequality and bemoaned that most people are unaware that \"hundreds of thousands or millions\" of small businesses have been negatively impacted. He also stated that the markets and the economy will likely be unpredictable well into the post-pandemic recovery period, even with the Biden administration and the United States Federal Reserve having a plan in place. He said the unpredictability and the effects of COVID-19 are far from over. [ 226 ] Film and television Aside from countless television appearances on various news programs ( Adam Smith 's Money World in 1985 reportedly being the first), [ 227 ] Buffett has appeared in numerous films and TV programs, both documentary, and fiction. Some film and television cameos he has made include Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps (2010), The Office (U.S.), All My Children , and Entourage (2015). [ 228 ] He has been a guest 10 times on Charlie Rose , and was the subject of the HBO documentary feature Becoming Warren Buffett (2017) and the BBC production The World's Greatest Money Maker (2009).

Grogan | CNBC Throughout his sparkling career as an investor, Berkshire Hathaway chairman Warren Buffett has become a leading role model for those looking to accumulate wealth . As the 94-year-old billionaire nears the end of his life, he hopes to provide guidance on how to distribute it as well. Buffett shared new details of his estate plan in a letter published on Monday , elaborating on how he intends to transfer the vast majority of his fortune to philanthropic causes. He will continue making contributions to certain charities while he's still alive, and plans remain in place for the remainder of his estate to go into a charitable trust overseen by his daughter and two sons. The three must decide unanimously which charitable organizations to donate to and in what quantities. Watch NBC 4 free wherever you are WATCH HERE This, Buffett explained earlier this year to the Wall Street Journal , was meant to give his children the leeway to respond to the changing needs of, and regulations around, charitable organizations. \"I like to think I can think outside the box, but I'm not sure if I can think outside the box when it's six feet below the surface and do a better job than three people who are on the surface who I trust completely,\" Buffett said. Get Tri-state area news delivered to your inbox with NBC New York's News Headlines newsletter. SIGN UP In his letter this week, Buffett made clear that, while his trust in his children's judgment hadn't wavered, he's realizing that, at ages 71, 69 and 66, they may not be able to distribute the entire estate during their lifetimes. So he installed three younger trustees to succeed his children, should they die before the trust runs out. Buffett communicated the plan to his children, who he nevertheless hopes will be able to distribute all of his assets. Money Report news 1 hour ago Stock futures tick higher ahead of Trump tariffs: Live updates news 1 hour ago Trump's tariffs are expected to raise consumer prices, but a key question remains: By how much? There's much to be learned from Buffett's active and transparent approach to estate planning, experts say \u2014 whether you have $100 million or even $100,000 to give away. \"He's really shown a lot of forethought. And he's built in flexibility from the beginning, because it's evolved,\" says Jose Reynoso, head of advanced estate and tax planning at Citizens Private Wealth. \"Start early and build in flexibility is a good idea whatever your level of wealth is.\" Why you need an estate plan now Even if you don't think you have much to bestow upon your heirs, having an estate plan means you get to decide what happens in the event of your death or incapacitation \u2014 not someone else. \"As a general matter, if you do not have an estate plan, the state will provide one,\" Reynoso says. That may very well mean health care and financial decisions running contrary to your wishes. To avoid confusion \u2014 and to keep your loved ones out of a lengthy and expensive legal process \u2014 you'd be wise to put together a basic estate plan. This might include: Beneficiary designations. Certain financial instruments, such as investments, bank accounts and life insurance policies, allow you to designate a beneficiary who receives the contents of your account upon your passing. These designations typically supersede a will, so it's essential to keep them up to date, especially following major life changes, experts say. Simple will. A will designates how you want your assets to be distributed in the event of your death. This is an easy one to draw up \u2014 templates can be found for free on websites such as LawDepot.com. Powers of attorney and advance directives. These can go by different names in different states, but the general gist is that they lay out your wishes and allow you to designate a decision-maker for you should you become incapacitated. The situation can get more complicated from there, and you'd be smart to consult an estate attorney to see what might work best for you. It may make sense to set up a trust, just like Buffett. The important thing to have in common with the billionaire, however, is the process: starting early and communicating often. \"It's a well-thought-out and communicated plan among the family,\" Reynoso says of the publicly available information from Buffett. \"That communication can help avoid issues that can come up down the line.\" Indeed, Buffett's recent letter contains a suggestion for all parents , \"whether they are of modest or staggering wealth\": \"When your children are mature, have them read your will before you sign it.\" How to estate plan like Buffett If you, like Buffett, want a significant amount of your wealth to go to charity after you pass, you can set up a charitable trust (like Buffett has) or a private foundation. However, these are costly options typically reserved for the very wealthy. Luckily, you can achieve a plan similar to Buffett's through a charitable account called a donor-advised fund, which is an account you control whose funds are earmarked for charitable giving. You typically open a DAF with a community foundation or through the charitable arm of a brokerage firm, such as Vanguard or Schwab, and there's often no minimum deposit. You can deposit assets, including cash, real estate and stock, into these accounts and, as the donor, choose how to invest the assets and where to donate them. The major draw for living donors is that you can get immediate tax deductions for donating to the fund, but can decide where the money actually goes later down the road. Should you die before deciding, a named successor can take over your account. Plus, if your fund contains appreciating assets, neither you nor the charity of your choice owes capital gains tax when you make a donation. It's a vehicle that is perfect for someone looking to emulate Buffett's model on a smaller scale, says Nicholas Yeomans, a certified financial planner, estate planning specialist and president of Yeomans Consulting Group. Naturally, it's always a good idea to talk to an estate planner or other financial professional before setting up such an account. \"You can fund [a DAF] while you're alive, but you can also fund it at death. And what's really cool about it is that it can give indefinitely,\" Yeomans says. That means you could set up multiple funds for your children to direct toward charitable causes of their choosing after you're gone, says Yeomans. Or you could make receiving other parts of an inheritance contingent upon deciding where money in the DAF goes as a family \u2014 kind of like the Buffett setup, but simpler. \"[Your DAF] can be perpetually giving to those churches, charities, museums \u2014 the things that you care about,\" says Yeomans. \"It doesn't have to have a separate tax ID number. It doesn't have a board of trustees. It doesn't have to have all the stuff that can take away from that money and be complicated and convoluted if you're just someone in middle America looking to make an impact.\" Ready to boost your income and career?

Grogan | CNBC Warren Buffett, who has amassed a $150 billion personal fortune, made a case against creating \"dynastic\" wealth as he named three independent trustees to oversee his philanthropy following his children and donated an additional $1.1 billion in Berkshire Hathaway stock to his family's four foundations. Instead of\u00a0leaving his three children an enormous inheritance, the 94-year-old legendary investor has long pledged to give away 99% of the fortune he built at Berkshire, the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate he has been running since 1965. Buffett believes family wealth dynasties could have negative consequences such as eroding personal growth and complicating relationships. Meanwhile, they also create societal uncertainties as it's unforeseeable how future generations choose to distribute such wealth. Watch NBC 4 free wherever you are WATCH HERE \"I've never wished to create a dynasty or pursue any plan that extended beyond the children,\" Buffett wrote in a lengthy letter Monday. \"I know the three well and trust them completely.

SIGN UP The \"Oracle of Omaha,\" who owns about 37.6% of Berkshire Class A shares, said the assets he's collected may take longer to deploy than his children live. He has appointed three trustees of his charitable trust to potentially succeed his children in disbursing his wealth. Buffett's children are now 71, 69 and 66. \"Three potential successor trustees have been designated. Each is well known to my children and makes sense to all of us. They are also somewhat younger than my children,\" Buffett wrote. \"But these successors are on the wait list. I hope Susie, Howie and Peter themselves disburse all of my assets.\" Money Report news 1 hour ago Stock futures tick higher ahead of Trump tariffs: Live updates news 1 hour ago Trump's tariffs are expected to raise consumer prices, but a key question remains: By how much? The identity of the trustees was not revealed. Buffett has been making annual donations to the four family foundations since 2006. He said he's built strong trust in his children's managerial ability and philanthropic ambition through years of observation. \"The 2006-2024 period gave me the chance to observe each of my children in action and they have learned much about large-scale philanthropy and human behavior,\" he said. \"They enjoy being comfortable financially, but they are not preoccupied with wealth. Their mother, from whom they learned these values, would be very proud of them. As am I.\" On Monday, Buffett converted 1,600 A shares into 2,400,000 B shares to donate to the four family foundations: 1,500,000 shares to The Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation and 300,000 shares to each of The Sherwood Foundation, The Howard G.

Since 2025, he has been a senior advisor to United States president Donald Trump and the de facto head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Musk is the wealthiest person in the world ; as of March\u00a02025, [update] Forbes estimates his net worth to be $320\u00a0billion USD. Born to a wealthy family in Pretoria , South Africa, Musk emigrated in 1989 to Canada, whose citizenship he had inherited through his mother. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in the U.S. before moving to California to pursue business ventures. In 1995, Musk co-founded the software company Zip2 . Following its sale in 1999, he co-founded X.com , an online payment company that later merged to form PayPal , which was acquired by eBay in 2002 for $1.5 billion. That year, Musk also became a U.S. citizen. In 2002, Musk founded SpaceX and became its CEO and chief engineer. The company has since led innovations in reusable rockets and commercial spaceflight . In 2004, Musk joined Tesla, Inc. as an early investor, and became its CEO and product architect in 2008; it has become a market leader in electric vehicles . In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI to advance artificial intelligence research, but left its board in 2018. In 2016, Musk co-founded Neuralink , a company focused on brain\u2013computer interfaces , and in 2017 launched the Boring Company , which aims to develop tunnel transportation. Musk was named Time magazine's Person of the Year in 2021. In 2022, he acquired Twitter, implementing significant changes and rebranding it as X in 2023. In January 2025, he was appointed head of Trump's newly created DOGE. Musk's political activities and views have made him a polarizing figure . He has been criticized for making unscientific and misleading statements, including COVID-19 misinformation and promoting conspiracy theories . His acquisition of Twitter (now X) was controversial due to a subsequent increase in hate speech and the spread of misinformation on the service. He has engaged in political activities in several countries, including as a vocal and financial supporter of Trump. Musk was the largest donor in the 2024 U.S. presidential election and is a supporter of global far-right figures, causes, and political parties. Early life See also: Musk family Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria , South Africa's administrative capital. [ 3 ] [ 4 ] He is of British and Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] His mother, Maye ( n\u00e9e Haldeman ), is a model and dietitian born in Saskatchewan , Canada, and raised in South Africa. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ a ] His father, Errol Musk , is a South African electromechanical engineer , pilot, sailor, consultant, emerald dealer, and property developer, who partly owned a rental lodge at Timbavati Private Nature Reserve . [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] Elon has a younger brother, Kimbal , a younger sister, Tosca , and four paternal half-siblings. [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 9 ] [ 21 ] Musk was raised in the Anglican Church , in which he was baptized . [ 22 ] [ 23 ] The Musk family was wealthy during Elon's youth. [ 18 ] Despite both Elon and Errol previously stating that Errol was a part owner of a Zambian emerald mine, [ 18 ] in 2023, Errol recounted that the deal he made was to receive \"a portion of the emeralds produced at three small mines\". [ 24 ] [ 25 ] Errol was elected to the Pretoria City Council as a representative of the anti-apartheid Progressive Party and has said that his children shared their father's dislike of apartheid . [ 3 ] After his parents divorced in 1980, Elon chose to live primarily with his father. [ 5 ] [ 15 ] Elon later regretted his decision and became estranged from his father. [ 26 ] Elon has recounted trips to a wilderness school that he described as a \"paramilitary Lord of the Flies \" where \"bullying was a virtue\" and children were encouraged to fight over rations. [ 27 ] In one incident, after an altercation with a fellow pupil, Elon was thrown down concrete steps and beaten severely, leading to him being hospitalized for his injuries. [ 28 ] Elon described his father berating him after he was discharged from the hospital. [ 28 ] Errol denied berating Elon and claimed, \"The boy had just lost his father to suicide and Elon had called him stupid. Elon had a tendency to call people stupid. How could I possibly blame that child?\" [ 29 ] Elon was an enthusiastic reader of books, and had attributed his success in part to having read The Lord of the Rings , the Foundation series , and The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy . [ 17 ] [ 30 ] At age ten, he developed an interest in computing and video games, teaching himself how to program from the VIC-20 user manual. [ 31 ] At age twelve, Elon sold his BASIC -based game Blastar to PC and Office Technology magazine for approximately $500. [ 32 ] [ 33 ] Education Musk graduated from Pretoria Boys High School in South Africa. Musk attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School , Bryanston High School , and then Pretoria Boys High School , where he graduated. [ 34 ] Musk was a good but unexceptional student, earning a 61 in Afrikaans and a B on his senior math certification. [ 35 ] Musk applied for a Canadian passport through his Canadian-born mother to avoid South Africa's mandatory military service , [ 36 ] [ 37 ] which would have forced him to participate in the apartheid regime, [ 3 ] as well as to ease his path to immigration to the United States. [ 38 ] While waiting for his application to be processed, he attended the University of Pretoria for five months. [ 39 ] Musk arrived in Canada in June 1989, connected with a second cousin in Saskatchewan, [ 40 ] [ 41 ] and worked odd jobs including at a farm and a lumber mill. [ 42 ] In 1990, he entered Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario . [ 43 ] [ 44 ] Two years later, he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania , where he studied until 1995. [ 45 ] Although Musk has said that he earned his degrees in 1995, the University of Pennsylvania did not award them until 1997 \u2013 a Bachelor of Arts in physics and a Bachelor of Science in economics from the university's Wharton School . [ 46 ] [ 47 ] [ 48 ] [ 49 ] [ 50 ] He reportedly hosted large, ticketed house parties to help pay for tuition, and wrote a business plan for an electronic book-scanning service similar to Google Books . [ 51 ] In 1994, Musk held two internships in Silicon Valley : one at energy storage startup Pinnacle Research Institute, which investigated electrolytic supercapacitors for energy storage, and another at Palo Alto \u2013based startup Rocket Science Games . [ 52 ] [ 53 ] In 1995, he was accepted to a graduate program in materials science at Stanford University , but did not enroll. [ 48 ] [ 46 ] [ 54 ] Musk decided to join the Internet boom , applying for a job at Netscape , to which he reportedly never received a response. [ 55 ] [ 36 ] The Washington Post reported that Musk lacked legal authorization to remain and work in the United States after failing to enroll at Stanford. [ 54 ] In response, Musk said he was allowed to work at that time and that his student visa transitioned to an H1-B . According to numerous former business associates and shareholders, Musk said he was on a student visa at the time. [ 56 ] Business career Main article: Business career of Elon Musk Zip2 Main article: Zip2 External videos Musk speaks of his early business experience during a 2014 commencement speech at University of Southern California on YouTube In 1995, Musk, his brother Kimbal, and Greg Kouri founded web software company Zip2 with funds borrowed from Musk's father. [ 57 ] [ 26 ] They housed the venture at a small rented office in Palo Alto. [ 58 ] The company developed and marketed an Internet city guide for the newspaper publishing industry, with maps, directions, and yellow pages. [ 59 ] According to Musk, \"The website was up during the day and I was coding it at night, seven days a week, all the time.\" [ 58 ] The Musk brothers obtained contracts with The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune , [ 60 ] and persuaded the board of directors to abandon plans for a merger with CitySearch . [ 61 ] Musk's attempts to become CEO were thwarted by the board. [ 62 ] Compaq acquired Zip2 for $307 million in cash in February 1999, [ 63 ] [ 64 ] and Musk received $22 million for his 7-percent share. [ 65 ] X.com and PayPal Main articles: X.com (bank) , PayPal , and PayPal Mafia In 1999, Musk co-founded X.com , an online financial services and e-mail payment company. [ 66 ] The startup was one of the first federally insured online banks, and, in its initial months of operation, over 200,000 customers joined the service. [ 67 ] The company's investors regarded Musk as inexperienced and replaced him with Intuit CEO Bill Harris by the end of the year. [ 68 ] The following year, X.com merged with online bank Confinity to avoid competition. [ 58 ] [ 68 ] [ 69 ] Founded by Max Levchin and Peter Thiel , [ 70 ] Confinity had its own money-transfer service, PayPal , which was more popular than X.com's service. [ 71 ] Within the merged company, Musk returned as CEO. Musk's preference for Microsoft software over Unix created a rift in the company and caused Thiel to resign. [ 72 ] Due to resulting technological issues and lack of a cohesive business model, the board ousted Musk and replaced him with Thiel in 2000. [ 73 ] [ b ] Under Thiel, the company focused on the PayPal service and was renamed PayPal in 2001. [ 75 ] [ 76 ] In 2002, PayPal was acquired by eBay for $1.5\u00a0billion in stock, of which Musk\u2014the largest shareholder with 11.72% of shares\u2014received $175.8\u00a0million. [ 77 ] [ 78 ] In 2017, Musk purchased the domain X.com from PayPal for an undisclosed amount, stating that it had sentimental value. [ 79 ] [ 80 ] SpaceX Main article: SpaceX Musk explains Starship capabilities to leaders of North American Aerospace Defense Command , U.S. Northern Command, and Air Force Space Command in 2019 In 2001, Musk became involved with the nonprofit Mars Society and discussed funding plans to place a growth-chamber for plants on Mars . [ 81 ] Seeking a way to launch the greenhouse payloads into space, Musk made two unsuccessful trips to Moscow to purchase intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) from Russian companies NPO Lavochkin and Kosmotras . Musk instead decided to start a company to build affordable rockets. [ 82 ] With $100\u00a0million of his early fortune, [ 83 ] Musk founded SpaceX in May 2002 and became the company's CEO and Chief Engineer. [ 84 ] [ 85 ] SpaceX attempted its first launch of the Falcon 1 rocket in 2006. [ 86 ] Although the rocket failed to reach Earth orbit , it was awarded a Commercial Orbital Transportation Services program contract from NASA , then led by Mike Griffin . [ 87 ] [ 88 ] After two more failed attempts that nearly caused Musk to go bankrupt, [ 86 ] SpaceX succeeded in launching the Falcon 1 into orbit in 2008. [ 89 ] Later that year, SpaceX received a $1.6\u00a0billion NASA contract for Falcon 9 -launched Dragon spacecraft flights to the International Space Station (ISS), replacing the Space Shuttle after its 2011 retirement . [ 90 ] In 2012, the Dragon vehicle docked with the ISS , a first for a commercial spacecraft. [ 91 ] Working towards its goal of reusable rockets , in 2015 SpaceX successfully landed the first stage of a Falcon 9 on a land platform. [ 92 ] Later landings were achieved on autonomous spaceport drone ships , an ocean-based recovery platform. [ 93 ] In 2018, SpaceX launched the Falcon Heavy ; the inaugural mission carried Musk's personal Tesla Roadster as a dummy payload . [ 94 ] [ 95 ] Since 2019, [ 96 ] SpaceX has been developing Starship , a reusable, super heavy-lift launch vehicle intended to replace the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy. [ 97 ] In 2020, SpaceX launched its first crewed flight, the Demo-2 , becoming the first private company to place astronauts into orbit and dock a crewed spacecraft with the ISS. [ 98 ] In 2024, NASA awarded SpaceX an $843 million contract to deorbit the ISS at the end of its lifespan. [ 99 ] Starlink Main article: Starlink See also: Starlink in the Russo-Ukrainian War 50 Starlink satellites shortly before deployment to low Earth orbit, 2019 In 2015, SpaceX began development of the Starlink constellation of low Earth orbit satellites to provide satellite Internet access . [ 100 ] After the launch of prototype satellites in 2018, the first large constellation was deployed in May 2019. [ 101 ] The total cost of the decade-long project to design, build, and deploy the constellation was estimated by SpaceX in 2020 to be $10\u00a0billion. [ 102 ] [ c ] During the Russian invasion of Ukraine , Musk provided free Starlink service to Ukraine , permitting Internet access and communication at a yearly cost to SpaceX of $400\u00a0million. [ 105 ] [ 106 ] [ 107 ] [ 108 ] [ 109 ] However, Musk refused to block Russian state media on Starlink. [ 110 ] [ 111 ] In 2023, Musk denied Ukraine's request to activate Starlink over Crimea to aid an attack against the Russian navy, citing fears of a nuclear response. [ 112 ] [ 113 ] [ 114 ] Tesla Main article: Tesla, Inc. Musk next to a Tesla Model S , 2011 Tesla, Inc. , originally Tesla Motors, was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning . Both men played active roles in the company's early development prior to Musk's involvement. [ 115 ] Musk led the Series A round of investment in February 2004; he invested $6.35\u00a0million, became the majority shareholder, and joined Tesla's board of directors as chairman. [ 116 ] [ 117 ] Musk took an active role within the company and oversaw Roadster product design, but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations. [ 118 ] Following a series of escalating conflicts in 2007, and the financial crisis of 2007\u20132008 , Eberhard was ousted from the firm. [ 119 ] [ page\u00a0needed ] [ 120 ] Musk assumed leadership of the company as CEO and product architect in 2008. [ 121 ] A 2009 lawsuit settlement with Eberhard designated Musk as a Tesla co-founder, along with Tarpenning and two others. [ 122 ] [ 123 ] Tesla began delivery of the Roadster, an electric sports car, in 2008. With sales of about 2,500 vehicles, it was the first mass production all-electric car to use lithium-ion battery cells. [ 124 ] Under Musk, Tesla has since launched several well-selling electric vehicles, including the four-door sedan Model S (2012), the crossover Model\u00a0X (2015), the mass-market sedan Model\u00a03 (2017), the crossover Model\u00a0Y (2020), and the pickup truck Cybertruck (2023). [ 125 ] [ 126 ] [ 127 ] [ 128 ] [ 129 ] In May 2020 Musk resigned from chairman of the board as part of the settlement of a lawsuit from the SEC over him tweeting that funding had been \"secured\" for potentially taking Tesla private. [ 130 ] [ 131 ] The company has also constructed multiple lithium-ion battery and electric vehicle factories, called Gigafactories . [ 132 ] Since its initial public offering in 2010, [ 133 ] Tesla stock has risen significantly; it became the most valuable carmaker in summer 2020, [ 134 ] [ 135 ] and it entered the S&P 500 later that year. [ 136 ] [ 137 ] In October 2021, it reached a market capitalization of $1\u00a0trillion, the sixth company in U.S. history to do so. [ 138 ] SolarCity and Tesla Energy Main articles: SolarCity and Tesla Energy SolarCity solar-panel installation vans in 2009 Musk provided the initial concept and financial capital for SolarCity , which his cousins Lyndon and Peter Rive founded in 2006. [ 139 ] By 2013, SolarCity was the second largest provider of solar power systems in the United States. [ 140 ] In 2014, Musk promoted the idea of SolarCity building an advanced production facility in Buffalo , New York, triple the size of the largest solar plant in the United States. [ 141 ] Construction of the factory started in 2014 and was completed in 2017. It operated as a joint venture with Panasonic until early 2020. [ 142 ] [ 143 ] Tesla acquired SolarCity for $2\u00a0billion in 2016 and merged it with its battery unit to create Tesla Energy . The deal's announcement resulted in a more than 10% drop in Tesla's stock price; at the time, SolarCity was facing liquidity issues. [ 144 ] Multiple shareholder groups filed a lawsuit against Musk and Tesla's directors, stating that the purchase of SolarCity was done solely to benefit Musk and came at the expense of Tesla and its shareholders. [ 145 ] [ 146 ] Tesla directors settled the lawsuit in January 2020, leaving Musk the sole remaining defendant. [ 147 ] [ 148 ] Two years later, the court ruled in Musk's favor. [ 149 ] Neuralink Main article: Neuralink Musk discussing a Neuralink device during a live demonstration in 2020 In 2016, Musk co-founded Neuralink , a neurotechnology startup, with an investment of $100\u00a0million. [ 150 ] [ 151 ] Neuralink aims to integrate the human brain with artificial intelligence (AI) by creating devices that are embedded in the brain. Such technology could enhance memory or allow the devices to communicate with software. [ 151 ] [ 152 ] The company also hopes to develop devices to treat neurological conditions like spinal cord injuries . [ 153 ] In 2022, Neuralink announced that clinical trials would begin by the end of the year. [ 154 ] In September 2023, the Food and Drug Administration approved Neuralink to initiate six-year human trials. [ 155 ] Neuralink has conducted animal testing on macaques at the University of California, Davis . In 2021, the company released a video in which a macaque played the video game Pong via a Neuralink implant. The company's animal trials\u2014which have caused the deaths of some monkeys\u2014have led to claims of animal cruelty . The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine has alleged that Neuralink violated the Animal Welfare Act . [ 156 ] Employees have complained that pressure from Musk to accelerate development has led to botched experiments and unnecessary animal deaths. In 2022, a federal probe was launched into possible animal welfare violations by Neuralink. [ 157 ] The Boring Company Main article: The Boring Company Musk during the 2018 inauguration of the Boring test tunnel in Hawthorne, California In 2017, Musk founded the Boring Company to construct tunnels, and revealed plans for specialized, underground, high-occupancy vehicles that could travel up to 150 miles per hour (240\u00a0km/h) and thus circumvent above-ground traffic in major cities. [ 158 ] [ 159 ] Early in 2017, the company began discussions with regulatory bodies and initiated construction of a 30-foot (9.1\u00a0m) wide, 50-foot (15\u00a0m) long, and 15-foot (4.6\u00a0m) deep \"test trench\" on the premises of SpaceX's offices, as that required no permits. [ 160 ] The Los Angeles tunnel , less than two miles (3.2\u00a0km) in length, debuted to journalists in 2018. It used Tesla Model\u00a0Xs and was reported to be a rough ride while traveling at suboptimal speeds. [ 161 ] Two tunnel projects announced in 2018, in Chicago and West Los Angeles, have been canceled. [ 162 ] [ 163 ] However, a tunnel beneath the Las Vegas Convention Center was completed in early 2021. [ 164 ] Local officials have approved further expansions of the tunnel system. [ 165 ] X Corp. Main articles: Acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk and Twitter under Elon Musk Avatar of Elon Musk Elon Musk @elonmusk I made an offer https://sec.gov/Archives/edgar... April 14, 2022 [ 166 ] In early 2017, Musk expressed interest in buying Twitter and had questioned the platform's commitment to freedom of speech . [ 167 ] [ 168 ] [ 169 ] By 2022, Musk had reached 9.2% stake in the company, [ 170 ] making him the largest shareholder. [ 171 ] [ d ] Musk later agreed to a deal that would appoint him to Twitter's board of directors and prohibit him from acquiring more than 14.9% of the company. [ 173 ] [ 174 ] Days later, Musk made a $43 billion offer to buy Twitter. [ 171 ] [ 175 ] By the end of April Musk had successfully concluded his bid for approximately $44\u00a0billion. [ 176 ] This included approximately $12.5 billion in loans and $21 billion in equity financing . [ 177 ] [ 178 ] Having back tracked on his initial decision, [ 179 ] Musk bought the company on October 27, 2022. [ 180 ] Immediately after the acquisition , Musk fired several top Twitter executives including CEO Parag Agrawal ; [ 180 ] [ 181 ] Musk became the CEO instead. [ 182 ] Under Elon Musk , Twitter instituted monthly subscription for a \" blue check \", [ 183 ] [ 184 ] [ 185 ] and laid off a significant portion of the company's staff. [ 186 ] [ 187 ] Musk lessened content moderation and hate speech also increased on the platform after his takeover. [ 188 ] [ 189 ] [ 190 ] [ 191 ] In late 2022, Musk released internal documents relating to Twitter's moderation of Hunter Biden's laptop controversy in the lead-up to the 2020 presidential election . [ 192 ] Musk also promised to step down as CEO after a Twitter poll, [ 193 ] [ 194 ] and five months later, Musk stepped down from chief executive officer (CEO)  and transitioned his role to executive chairman and chief technology officer (CTO). [ 195 ] Despite Musk stepping down as CEO , X continues to struggle with challenges such as viral misinformation , [ 196 ] hate speech , and antisemitism controversies.

[ 351 ] [ f ] The securities fraud lawsuit characterized the tweet as false, misleading, and damaging to investors, and sought to bar Musk from serving as CEO of publicly traded companies . [ 351 ] [ 355 ] [ 356 ] Two days later, Musk settled with the SEC, without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations. As a result, Musk and Tesla were fined $20\u00a0million each, and Musk was forced to step down for three years as Tesla chairman but was able to remain as CEO. [ 357 ] Shareholders filed a lawsuit over the tweet, [ 358 ] and in February 2023, a jury found Musk and Tesla not liable. [ 359 ] Musk has stated in interviews that he does not regret posting the tweet that triggered the SEC investigation. [ 360 ] [ 361 ] In 2019, Musk stated in a tweet that Tesla would build half\u00a0a\u00a0million cars that year. [ 362 ] The SEC reacted by asking a court to hold him in contempt for violating the terms of the 2018 settlement agreement. A joint agreement between Musk and the SEC eventually clarified the previous agreement details, [ 363 ] including a list of topics about which Musk needed preclearance. [ 364 ] In 2020, a judge blocked a lawsuit that claimed a tweet by Musk regarding Tesla stock price (\"too high imo \") violated the agreement.

[ 375 ] From the early 2000s until late 2020, Musk resided in California, where both Tesla and SpaceX were founded.

[ 398 ] [ 397 ] [ 399 ] In 2024 and 2025, Musk criticized the video game Assassin's Creed Shadows and its creator Ubisoft for \"woke\" content. [ 400 ] In 2024, Musk posted to X that \"DEI kills art\" and specified the inclusion of the historical figure Yasuke in the Assassin's Creed game as offensive. Ubisoft responded by saying that Musk's comments were \"just feeding hatred\" and that they were focused on producing a game not pushing politics. [ 401 ] In March 2025, after Musk called Shadows a \"terrible game\" and Hasan Piker a \"fraud\" for promoting it, the game's official X account replied \"is that what the guy playing your Path of Exile 2 account told you?\" [ 402 ] [ 403 ] The post's ratio was signifcantly in Ubisoft's favor.

By Biography.com Editors , Tyler Piccotti and Catherine Caruso Updated: Apr 01, 2025 5:39 PM EDT Getty Images We may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back. 1971\u2013present Elon Musk News: Entrepreneur Sells X to His Own AI Company Elon Musk has sold his social media platform X, formerly Twitter, to his artificial intelligence startup xAI in an all-stock deal valued at $33 billion. Musk announced the merger in an X post on March 28, claiming that the future of the two companies are \u201cintertwined.\u201d \u201cToday, we officially take the step to combine the data, models, compute, distribution and talent,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis combination will unlock immense potential by blending xAI\u2019s advanced AI capability and expertise with X\u2019s massive reach.\u201d The 53-year-old originally purchased X in 2022 for $45 billion, which he paid for by pledging Tesla stock as loan collateral. Since then, X has accrued $12 billion in debt and Tesla stock has plummeted significantly. The new acquisition swaps Tesla shares for xAI stocks, which are privately traded. According to Musk, xAI is now valued at $80 billion. While he didn\u2019t reveal if there will be any new AI tools available on X to the existing chatbot Grok, the tech billionaire said \u201cthe combined company will deliver smarter, more meaningful experiences to billions of people.\u201d Jump to: Who Is Elon Musk? Quick Facts Where Is Elon Musk From? Education Companies: SpaceX, Tesla, Twitter, and More Inventions Net Worth Ex-Wives and Children Advisor to Donald Trump SEC Investigation and Lawsuit Personal Life: Religion, Asperger\u2019s Syndrome, and More Quotes Who Is Elon Musk? Elon Musk is the founder of SpaceX and Tesla Motors, among other companies. Their success has propelled him to become the richest person in the world, with a net worth greater than $316 billion. The South African\u2013born entrepreneur started his first businesses in the 1990s: an online city guide called Zip2 and a digital payment company named X.com, which later became PayPal. Musk, who became an American citizen in 2002, then moved into the transportation industry via his most recognizable companies. He diversified his holdings in 2022 by purchasing Twitter, which he renamed X. A vehement supporter of U.S. President Donald Trump , Musk is head of the Department of Government Efficiency, the headline-grabbing advisory group under Trump\u2019s second administration. Beyond his professional life, Musk is a father to 14 kids . Quick Facts FULL NAME: Elon Reeve Musk BORN: June 28, 1971 BIRTHPLACE: Pretoria, South Africa SPOUSES: Justine Wilson (2000\u20132008) and Talulah Riley (2010\u201312; 2013\u201316) CHILDREN: Nevada, Vivian, Griffin, Kai, Saxon, Damian, X \u00c6 A-Xii, Strider, Azure, Exa, Techno, Arcadia, Seldon, and R.S.C. ASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Cancer Where Is Elon Musk From? Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa. His mother, Maye Musk , is a Canadian model and the oldest woman to star in a CoverGirl campaign. When Elon was growing up, she worked five jobs at one point to support her family. Elon\u2019s father, Errol Musk, is a wealthy South African engineer. Elon spent his early childhood with his brother, Kimbal, and sister, Tosca, in South Africa. His parents divorced when he was 10. Around this time, Musk developed an interest in computers and taught himself how to program. When he was 12 years old, Musk developed his own game called Blastar that he sold for $500. He was often so lost in his daydreams about inventions that his parents and doctors ordered a test to check his hearing. The short, introverted, and bookish child was bullied until he was 15. By that point, he went through a growth spurt and learned how to defend himself with karate and wrestling. He has continued to practice martial arts as an adult. At age 17, in 1988, Elon moved to Canada against his parents\u2019 wishes to attend university and avoid mandatory service in the South African military. He obtained his Canadian citizenship that year, in part because he felt it would be easier to obtain U.S. citizenship via that path. Elon moved to the United States a few years later and officially became an American citizen in 2002. \u201cI came to North America because I felt this was where there was opportunity to do great things in technology,\u201d he said in 2013. More Tech Innovators Bill Gates Steve Jobs Mark Zuckerberg Education Musk\u2019s move to Canada coincided with his enrollment in Queen\u2019s University in Kingston, Ontario. He studied there for two years before transferring to the University of Pennsylvania in 1992. He graduated five years later with bachelor\u2019s degrees in economics and physics. Musk then headed to Stanford University to pursue a doctorate in energy physics. However, his relocation to California was timed perfectly with the internet boom, and he dropped out of Stanford after just two days in favor of joining the rising tech wave. Companies: SpaceX, Tesla, Twitter, and More Getty Images Now one of his most recognizable entities, SpaceX was the third company Elon Musk founded. Musk launched his first company while he was still in college. Today, he leads several businesses, including SpaceX, Tesla Motors, and social media site X (previously Twitter). His current and past ventures include: Zip2 and X.com (now PayPal) The soon-to-be serial entrepreneur launched his first company, Zip2 Corporation, in 1995 with his brother, Kimbal. An online city guide, Zip2 was soon providing content for the new websites of The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune . In 1999, a division of Compaq Computer Corporation bought Zip2 for $307 million in cash and $34 million in stock options. The Musk brothers immediately used the money from Zip2\u2019s sale to found X.com, an online financial services and payments company. The following year, in 2000, X.com merged with a similar company businessman Peter Thiel had founded. Elon briefly served as CEO before being pushed out. Thiel assumed leadership and renamed the company PayPal. SpaceX Musk founded his third company\u2014Space Exploration Technologies Corporation, or SpaceX\u2014in 2002 with the intention of building spacecraft for commercial space travel. A key tenet of the Texas-based company and its research has been improving the sustainability of spacecraft in an effort to save costs on space travel. According to SpaceX , its Falcon 9 is the first orbital class rocket capable of reflight. It can be reused more than 10 times, with decreased maintenance between flights. Elsewhere, the company recently completed a test flight in which its first-stage booster returned to the launchpad shortly following takeoff. SpaceX was well established by 2008 when NASA awarded the company the contract to handle cargo transport for the International Space Station in a move to replace the U.S. government\u2019s own space shuttle missions. Plans for SpaceX to takeover future astronaut transport were also drawn up. The company continues to receive government contracts today. On May 22, 2012, SpaceX launched a Falcon 9 rocket into space with an unmanned Dragon capsule. The Dragon was sent to the ISS with 1,000 pounds of supplies for the astronauts stationed there, marking the first time a private company had sent a spacecraft to the space station. \u201cI feel very lucky,\u201d Musk said about the launch. \u201cFor us, it\u2019s like winning the Super Bowl.\u201d SpaceX has since made more than 20 cargo deliveries to the ISS. Its Falcon 9 rockets have also carried satellites into orbit, including one designed to observe the sun\u2019s extreme emissions that affect power grids and communications systems on Earth. Many satellites are part of the company\u2019s Starlink internet service. Another historic milestone arrived on May 30, 2020, when two NASA astronauts aboard the SpaceX Crew Dragon lifted off from Kennedy Space Center on a Falcon 9 rocket. It was the first time an American crew launched from U.S. soil in a commercially built American spacecraft to go to the ISS. NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine called the achievement an \u201cimportant step on our path to expand human exploration to the Moon and Mars.\u201d Beyond these missions, SpaceX has continued to build out its fleet of rockets and spacecraft. Newer iterations of the Falcon 9 have been developed over the years. The company also now has a Falcon Heavy rocket, armed with three Falcon 9 engine cores, that\u2019s designed to carry immense payloads into orbit and potentially serve as a vehicle for deep space missions. An even bigger engineering project began around 2016. The BFR, an acronym for Big Falcon Rocket or Big F\u2013\u2013ing Rocket, was initially conceived as 42-engine behemoth topped by a spaceship capable of carrying at least 100 people. A next-generation BFR was introduced in 2019 with the name Starship. The current design includes a Starship spacecraft and a Super Heavy rocket outfitted with 33 Raptor engines. Test flights began in April 2023. Starlink Starlink, a division of SpaceX, is a satellite network that has made broadband internet service more accessible in rural areas and has boosted competition in heavily populated markets that are typically dominated by one or two providers. After receiving permission from the U.S. government to launch a fleet of satellites into low orbit in late March 2018, SpaceX launched the first batch of 60 satellites in May 2019. Another payload of 60 satellites followed that November. According to data from the the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics from July 2024, Starlink is now responsible for about 60 percent of the more than 10,000 active satellites in orbit. The company has short-term plans to increase its total to more than 12,000. The appearance of these bright orbiters in the night sky has worried some astronomers who feel a proliferation of satellites increases the difficulty of studying distant objects in space. Even so, Starlink\u2019s impact on Earth is apparent. In May 2024, Musk shared that more than 3 million customers in 99 countries rely on the internet provider. Its materials have also helped the Ukrainian military collect intelligence and coordinate drone attacks during its ongoing war with Russia. Tesla Motors Musk is the cofounder, CEO, and product architect at Tesla Motors, a company formed in 2003 that is dedicated to producing affordable, mass-market electric cars as well as battery products and solar roofs. Musk oversees all product development, engineering, and design of the Texas-based company\u2019s products. In the two-plus decades since its formation, Tesla has unveiled a series of electric vehicles at multiple price points, including some with self-driving capabilities. The first was the Roadster, a sports car launched in 2008 with a travel range of nearly 250 miles between charges of its lithium-ion battery. It\u2019s capable of accelerating from 0 to 60 mph in 3.7 seconds. The Tesla lineup now includes the Model S and the more affordable Model 3 sedans, the Model X and Model Y crossover SUVs, and the Cybertruck. Boasting a 265-mile range, the first-generation Model S was named the 2013 Car of the Year by MotorTrend . (Editor\u2019s note: Like Biography , MotorTrend is owned by Hearst Magazines.) By 2019, Tesla was responsible or about 75 percent of electric vehicle sales in the United States, but its share dipped to as little as 49 percent by the second quarter of 2024. This is partly due to repeated production issues, safety concerns, and company downsizing. It took four years for the Model S to enter production after it was first announced in August 2008. The Model 3 was delayed three times before arriving to market in early 2019, and its production problems ultimately prompted Musk to personally oversee engineering efforts at Tesla. Similarly, the Cybertruck was first introduced in November 2019. When the electric pickup finally became available in November 2023, the cost had increased around $21,000. Delays haven\u2019t been the only issue to plague the Cybertruck, whose \u201ccyberpunk\u201d style was inspired by the movies Blade Runner and The Spy Who Loved Me . The truck wasn\u2019t crash-tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration or the Insurance Institute of Highway Safety, and concerns rose about the lack of crush zones on the vehicle body. This means passengers might feel higher impacts in the event of an accident. In August 2024, two separate incidents occurred in Texas in which the vehicles caught fire\u2014 one of which killed the driver . As of November 2024, Tesla has initiated six recalls for the Cybertruck , and the vehicle is the subject of at least four NHTSA investigations into possible safety defects. Amid these challenges, Tesla has navigated several significant layoffs. In 2018, Musk announced 9 percent of its workforce would be let go. The company has experienced similar downsizing in more recent years, reportedly losing as much as 14 percent of its workforce in 2024 alone. Tesla continues working on the Semi, a new commercial truck, and the second-generation Roadster that the company promises to be the fastest-accelerating production car with a 0-to-60 time of 1.9 seconds . Both projects were unveiled in November 2017 and are still not on the market as of December 2024. SolarCity Acquisition Solar panel manufacturer SolarCity, now a part of Tesla Motors, was founded by two of Musk\u2019s cousins in 2006. Musk invested in the company and served as its board chairman. In 2016, in his continuing effort to promote and advance sustainable energy and products for a wider consumer base, Musk announced Tesla would buy SolarCity for $2.6 billion in an all-stock deal. The acquisition, completed in November 2016, placed Musk in hot water when some Tesla shareholders filed a lawsuit alleging the deal was unfair and claiming Musk had acted in his own interest, not Tesla\u2019s. A Delaware Chancery Court judge ruled in favor of Musk in 2022, determining he hadn\u2019t acted outside his fiduciary duty. That decision was upheld by the state supreme court in June 2023. The Boring Company In January 2017, Musk launched The Boring Company that\u2019s devoted to boring and building tunnels as a way to reduce street traffic. Like many of his other companies, its headquarters are in Texas. Musk began with a test dig on SpaceX property in Los Angeles. In late October 2017, Musk posted the first photo of his company\u2019s progress to his Instagram page. He said the 500-foot tunnel, which would generally run parallel to Interstate 405, would reach a length of two miles in approximately four months. In May 2019, the company, now known as TBC, landed a $48.7 million contract from the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority to build an underground Loop system to shuttle people around the Las Vegas Convention Center. The Loop opened in April 2021 and has transported more than 1.5 million visitors. That project came after an ultimately unsuccessful effort to build and operate a high-speed rail line in Chicago. After then-Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel asked for proposals in November 2017 for rail lines between O\u2019Hare Airport and downtown Chicago that would take 20 minutes or less, Musk tweeted that he was all-in on the competition with The Boring Company. In summer 2018, Musk announced he would cover the estimated $1 billion needed to dig the 17-mile tunnel. However, in late 2019, he tweeted TBC would focus on completing the commercial tunnel in Las Vegas before turning to other projects. In a one-off stunt, Musk announced The Boring Company would make flamethrowers about a year into its founding. After sharing that they were going on sale for $500 apiece in late January 2018, he claimed to have sold 10,000 of them within a day. Buying Twitter and Conversion to\u00a0X In January 2022, Musk began investing in social media site Twitter. Within two months, he became the company\u2019s largest shareholder with a stake of more than 9 percent. On April 15, Musk made an offer to purchase Twitter outright , valuing the company at around $43 billion according to a securities filing . \u201cI invested in Twitter as I believe in its potential to be the platform for free speech around the globe, and I believe free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy.\u201d Musk said . \u201cTwitter needs to be transformed as a private company.\u201d Despite the company\u2019s initial acceptance, a months-long dispute over the sale ensued during which Musk threatened to terminate the deal given the prevalence of bots and fake accounts on the platform. Finally in October 2022, Musk officially bought Twitter and became the social media company\u2019s CEO. The transition drew backlash, as Twitter announced early that November it had begun layoffs that would affect roughly half of its 7,500-person workforce. Musk additionally introduced a subscription-based verification service, which had previously been awarded to notable accounts for free as a form of authentication. In May 2024, Musk appointed Linda Yaccarino as the new CEO, and a few weeks later in July, the site rebranded as X and shed its bird-themed logo. The company is based in Bastrop, Texas. While the site now serves as one of Musk\u2019s primary communication outlets, its value has steeply declined since the purchase. Per CNN , the investment company Fidelity estimated the value of X had dropped 80 percent by October 2024. At least 30 lawsuits have been filed against X for refusal to pay former employees and vendors, according to The Hollywood Reporter . In March 2025, Musk sold X to his artificial intelligence startup xAI in an all-stock deal valued at $33 billion.\u00a0\u201cThis combination will unlock immense potential by blending xAI\u2019s advanced AI capability and expertise with X\u2019s massive reach,\u201d he said. OpenAI and xAI Musk has pursued an interest in artificial intelligence initially by cofounding the nonprofit OpenAI. The research company launched in late 2015 with the stated mission of advancing digital intelligence to benefit humanity. Two years later, Musk left the company and his post as co-chair following an internal dispute, which led to Sam Altman becoming CEO. OpenAI has since launched the popular chat software ChatGPT, which went live in 2022. In July 2023, Musk announced the formation of xAI. Now headquartered in San Francisco, the company\u2019s mission is to \u201cadvance our collective understanding of the universe\u201d through artificial intelligence programs. The xAI Grok model was introduced to premium users on X starting that December. In May 2024, the AI startup announced it had attracted $6 billion in investments. The following March, xAI acquired Musk\u2019s social media site, X, in a $33 billion all-stock deal. Despite xAI\u2019s growth, Musk is still paying mind to OpenAI. In August 2024, he sued the now-rival company, alleging OpenAI betrayed its founding purpose of benefitting the public good in favor of becoming a for-profit business. The ongoing case went to federal court that December. Separately, Musk joined a group of investors in offering to buy OpenAI in February 2025; CEO Altman rejected the lowball offer. Inventions Through SpaceX and Tesla, Musk has achieved notable advancements in sustainable space exploration as well as driverless transportation with the research and launch of Full Self-Driving software . Musk has brought this pioneering spirit to other ventures but with mixed results.  Among the inventions Musk has spent the most time and money to research are a new high-speed public transportation system and biological software connectivity. Hyperloop In August 2013, Musk released a concept for a new form of transportation called the \u201cHyperloop\u201d that would would propel riders in pods through a network of low-pressure tubes at speeds reaching more than 700 mph. He proposed the transit system be built between San Francisco and Los Angeles, an endeavor that the inventor noted could take from seven to 10 years to be built and ready for use. He suggested the Hyperloop run on renewable energy. Did You Know? Elon Musk Was the Model for Iron Man Tony Stark Passing off the concept to fellow entrepreneurs, a startup formed to pursue the Hyperloop in 2014. For a time, it was owned by British entrepreneur Richard Branson , but by December 2023, Bloomberg reported the company began to sell off its assets and lay off remaining employees. Neuralink In 2017, it was reported that Musk was backing a venture called Neuralink, which intended to create devices to be implanted in the human brain and help people merge with software. Its devices consist of a microscopic chip that connects via Bluetooth to a smartphone or computer. Concerns over the project arose in 2023, when veterinary records reportedly showed that monkeys receiving the implant in tests suffered \u201cdebilitating heath defects\u201d including paralysis and brain swelling. Musk downplayed any risks, saying that only \u201cterminal\u201d monkeys received the implant and that none had died from the experiments. In January 2024, Neuralink completed its first implant in a human subject , with Musk saying the results showed promise. A year later, the businessman reported there are now three people with Neuralink implants, and he hopes 20 to 30 more people will join them in 2025. Net Worth Musk is the richest person in the world, a title he has held at various points since early 2021. He regularly swaps spots with Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and French businessman Bernard Arnault, who is the founder and CEO of luxury goods conglomerate LVMH. According to Forbes\u2019 Real-Time Billionaires List , Musk is worth $346.4 billion as of April 1, 2025. Bloomberg \u2019s estimate is lower, totaling Musk\u2019s fortune at around $316 billion . Because much of his net worth is tied up in stock, Musk\u2019s wealth is highly variable. Related Stories The 15 Richest Actors in the World What Is Soccer Star Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s Net Worth? Breaking Down Michael Jordan's Record-Setting Net Worth A large portion of Musk\u2019s wealth stems from his shares and options in Tesla, which the Washington Post reported to be around $120 billion as of June 2024. That number is almost certainly even higher now as Tesla\u2019s value has grown significantly since. Musk\u2019s first major financial windfall came via the sale of Zip2 in 1999, which earned him $22 million for his stake. He invested that money into X.com, which turned into a $165 million sum following eBay\u2019s purchase of the renamed PayPal in 2002 and allowed Musk to earn his first billion. Musk became the first person in history to boast a net worth of $400 billion or more in December 2024. The Washington Post reported the entrepreneur\u2019s net worth grew by more than $200 billion that year. The unprecedented feat followed Musk\u2019s historic milestone of becoming the first person to lose $200 billion at the end of 2022. Ex-Wives and Children Although Musk is currently single, he has been married three times to two women and has 13 living children. His firstborn died as an infant. Ex-Wife Justine Musk In 2000, the entrepreneur wed Justine Wilson, who then changed her last name to Musk. They met as students at Queen\u2019s University. In 2002, their first son, Nevada, died at 10 weeks old from sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). The loss didn\u2019t prevent them from growing their family later on. Elon and Justine welcomed twins, Griffin and Vivian, in 2004 followed by triplets\u2014Kai, Saxon, and Damian\u2014in two years later. All five children were conceived through in vitro fertilization. Vivian is transgender and legally changed her name to Vivian Jenna Wilson in 2022. She doesn\u2019t wish to be associated with Elon in any way. In a 2024 interview with NBC News , she called her father \u201cuncaring and narcissistic\u201d and said he was cruel to her as a child for being queer. Ultimately, Elon and Justine\u2019s marriage broke down. Their contentious divorce was finalized in 2008. Ex-Wife Talulah Riley Getty Images Elon Musk and actor Talulah Riley have been married and divorced twice. Musk met actor Talulah Riley after his first marriage collapsed. Today, she is best known for her roles in the 2005 movie Pride & Prejudice and the TV show Westworld . Musk and Riley married in 2010 but split by 2012. They decided to marry again in 2013, but their relationship ultimately ended in a second divorce in 2016. Relationship with Amber Heard Musk reportedly began dating actor Amber Heard in 2016 after finalizing his second divorce with Riley and following Heard\u2019s divorce from actor Johnny Depp . Their busy schedules caused Musk and Heard to break up in August 2017. The couple got back together in January 2018 and split again one month later. Relationship with Grimes Getty Images Elon Musk and Grimes attend the Met Gala in May 2018. In May 2018, Musk began dating musician Grimes, whose real name is Claire Boucher. That month, Grimes announced she had changed her name to \u201c c ,\u201d the symbol for the speed of light, reportedly at the encouragement of Musk. Fans criticized the feminist performer for dating a billionaire whose company had been described as a \u201cpredator zone\u201d amid accusations of sexual harassment. However, the couple discussed their love for one another in a March 2019 feature in the Wall Street Journal Magazine . Musk told the Journal, \u201cI love c \u2019s wild fae artistic creativity and hyper-intense work ethic.\u201d Grimes gave birth to their first son in early May 2020, with Musk announcing they named the boy X \u00c6 A-12. The name was partly inspired by the Lockheed A-12 reconnaissance aircraft. Later in the month, after it was reported that the State of California wouldn\u2019t accept a name with a number, the couple said they were changing their son\u2019s name to X \u00c6 A-Xii. Musk and Grimes welcomed their second child, a daughter named Exa Dark Sider\u00e6l Musk, in December 2021. The child was delivered via a surrogate. In September 2023, journalist Walter Isaacson revealed in his biography about Musk that Grimes and Musk had a third child , a son named Techno Mechanicus and nicknamed \u201cTau.\u201d Grimes announced in March 2022 that she and Musk had broken up. Kids with Shivon Zilis During his relationship with Grimes, Musk quietly welcomed two children, a son named Strider and a daughter named Azure, with Shivon Zilis in November 2021. Zilis is the project director of his Neuralink company. Since then, she has had two more children with Musk. Their daughter Arcadia was born in February 2024, and they have another son named Seldon. The New York Times reports Zilis and the kids live on a compound in Austin, Texas, that Musk helped purchase. The property includes two mansions and is close to a third home Musk regularly stays at when he\u2019s in town. A day after the Times article was published, the entrepreneur told Page Six he didn\u2019t own and isn\u2019t building such a compound. Child with Ashley St. Clair In February 2025, conservative influencer Ashley St. Clair announced she had a brief romantic relationship with Musk that resulted in a baby boy, whose initials are R.S.C. Musk hasn\u2019t confirmed his role as the boy\u2019s father, and the would-be co-parents are currently in a custody lawsuit. St. Clair is seeking to establish the billionaire is her son\u2019s dad as part of the suit. Advisor to Donald Trump After Donald Trump was elected U.S. president in 2016, Musk found himself on common ground with the incoming commander-in-chief and his advisers as Trump announced plans to pursue massive infrastructure developments. That December, Musk was named to the president-elect\u2019s Strategy and Policy Forum. Further solidifying their collaboration, he joined Trump\u2019s Manufacturing Jobs Initiative in January 2017. While sometimes at odds with the president\u2019s controversial measures, such as a ban on immigrants from Muslim-majority countries, Musk defended his involvement with the new administration. \u201cMy goals,\u201d he tweeted in early 2017, \u201care to accelerate the world\u2019s transition to sustainable energy and to help make humanity a multi-planet civilization, a consequence of which will be the creating of hundreds of thousands of jobs and a more inspiring future for all.\u201d Following Trump\u2019s announcement in June 2017 that he was withdrawing the United States from the Paris climate accord, Musk stepped down from his advisory roles. Getty Images Elon Musk, who had served as an advisor in President Donald Trump\u2019s first administration, took an active role in the Republican candidate\u2019s 2024 reelection campaign. Despite their uneven relationship during Trump\u2019s first administration, Musk endorsed the Republican nominee for president in the 2024 election against Vice President Kamala Harris . Following an attempted assassination of Trump at a rally near Butler, Pennsylvania, in July 2024, Musk said he would appear with Trump for another rally at the same location in October. Later that month, Musk announced he would randomly give away $1 million dollars each day to a person who signed a petition from his political action committee supporting the Constitution as part of an effort to register voters who might support Trump. The giveaway became the subject of a lawsuit in Pennsylvania alleging it could improperly influence the November 5 election, but Musk\u2019s lawyers argued that recipients were not actually chosen randomly, and a judge allowed the prizes to continue. Trump ultimately won a second term as president. Musk had an up-close view of Trump\u2019s inauguration come January 2025 and even spoke at a modified Presidential Parade, held indoors like the rest of the inaugural events on account of extreme cold. During his brief remarks, he made a straight-arm salute that caused controversy as some people likened it to the Nazi salute. The president quickly appointed Musk to lead a temporary organization called the Department of Government Efficiency that works to cut unnecessary federal spending and modernize technology within the federal government. Trump has granted DOGE 18 months to accomplish its mission before disbanding in early July 2026. \u201cElon Musk is a once in a generation business leader, and our federal bureaucracy will certainly benefit from his ideas and efficiency,\u201d a Trump transition team spokesperson said . DOGE has been quick to announce deep cuts that have impacted more than 30 federal departments and agencies. Around 131,100 government employees have taken buyouts or been laid off, per The New York Times . Other downsizing has taken shape in the cancellation of contracts, grants, and office leases. Per its official website, DOGE estimates the measures are saving $140 billion . However, critics have pointed holes in the calculation, noting that some figures included in the total are contracts already set to expire, for example. The activity has prompted a slew of lawsuits, some regarding the constitutionality of the cuts, as well as backlash against Musk, who the White House has said is a senior presidential advisor and not the official DOGE administrator in court filings. Protestors have taken to demonstrating at or vandalizing Tesla showrooms, and some car owners are seeking to sell their models to distance themselves from the controversial billionaire. SEC Investigation and Lawsuit Not entirely surprising for the CEO of major public companies, Musk has at times faced scrutiny over his business decisions as well as his own investments. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigated the entrepreneur in 2018 after he floated the possibility of making Tesla a private company. Several years later, in 2025, the SEC filed a ongoing lawsuit against Musk concerning his shares in Twitter prior to purchasing the now-private company and renaming it. 2018 SEC Investigation Prior to his purchase of the site, Twitter was the genesis of a financial scandal involving Musk. On August 7, 2018, Musk dropped a bombshell via a tweet: \u201cAm considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.\u201d The announcement opened the door for legal action against the company and its founder, as the SEC began inquiring about whether Musk had indeed secured the funding as claimed. Several investors filed lawsuits on the grounds that Musk was looking to manipulate stock prices and ambush short sellers with his tweet. Musk\u2019s tweet initially sent Tesla stock spiking, before it closed the day up 11 percent. The CEO followed up with a letter on the company blog, calling the move to go private \u201cthe best path forward.\u201d He promised to retain his stake in the company and added that he would create a special fund to help all current investors remain on board. Six days later, Musk sought to clarify his position with a statement in which he pointed to discussions with the managing director of the Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund as the source of his \u201cfunding secured\u201d declaration. He later tweeted that he was working on a proposal to take Tesla private with Goldman Sachs and Silver Lake as financial advisers. On August 24, one day after meeting with the board, Musk announced that he had reversed course and wouldn\u2019t be taking the company private. Among his reasons, he cited the preference of most directors to keep Tesla public, as well as the difficulty of retaining some of the large shareholders who were prohibited from investing in a private company. On September 29, 2018, it was announced that Musk would pay a $20 million fine and step down as chairman of Tesla\u2019s board for three years as part of an agreement with the SEC. 2025 SEC Lawsuit More than six year later, in January 2025, the SEC sued Musk for allegedly failing to disclose his large stake in X in 2022, before he purchased the social media site then known as Twitter. The ongoing federal lawsuit contends that Musk committed securities fraud by not disclosing that he owned more than 5 percent of Twitter\u2019s shares until 11 days after the report was due, allowing him to buy stock in the company at \u201cartificially low prices.\u201d According to the SEC, the Tesla and SpaceX founder underpaid investors by $150 million for the additional shares he bought after surpassing the 5 percent ownership threshold. \u201cHad Musk and his wealth manager disclosed his ownership as required, the stock price would likely have increased significantly,\u201d the suit reads. In its complaint, the SEC requested that the court order Musk to pay \u201cdisgorgement of his unjust enrichment\u201d as well as a civil penalty. Musk  responded to the filing in an X post , calling the SEC a \u201ctotally broken organization\u201d that is spending their time on him \u201cwhen there are so many actual crimes that go unpunished.\u201d Personal Life: Religion, Asperger\u2019s Syndrome, and More Beyond his work and family lives, Musk is an avid video game player. Biographer Walter Isaacson, who released an authorized account of Musk\u2019s life in 2023, even classified the hobby as an \u201caddiction.\u201d He is a big fan of Elden Ring , which he previously called \u201cthe most beautiful art I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d Elon Musk by Walter Isaacson Now 42% Off $20 at Amazon Isaacson\u2019s biography about Musk, which was a No. 1 New York Times bestseller, is currently in the process of becoming a biopic. Director Darren Aronofsky is attached to the movie. \u201cGlad Darren is doing it,\u201d Musk shared on social media after news about the project broke in late 2023. \u201cHe is one of the best.\u201d Where Does Elon Musk Live? In May 2020, Musk claimed in a series of social media posts he planned to sell nearly all of his physical possessions. According to biographer Walter Isaacson , this eventually spurred Musk to sell multiple properties and make a $50,000 rental home in Boca Chica, Texas, his primary residence. The house is located near SpaceX\u2019s development and testing site. Asperger\u2019s Syndrome In May 2021, Musk revealed while hosting an episode of the sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live that he has Asperger\u2019s syndrome , a developmental disorder that can cause difficulty with socialization and communication as well as obsessive interest in very specific topics. He elaborated further about his experience growing up with the condition a year later. \u201cI would just tend to take things very literally\u2026 but then that turned out to be wrong\u2014[people were not] simply saying exactly what they mean, there\u2019s all sorts of other things that are meant, and [it] took me a while to figure that out,\u201d Musk explained at the TED2022 conference. Religion and Political Views Although long considered an atheist, Musk said in 2024 he considers himself a \u201ccultural Christian\u201d and believes in the teachings of Jesus Christ \u2014even though he might not follow all tenets of the faith. \u201cI do believe that the teachings of Jesus are good and wise,\u201d he said in an interview with psychologist and podcast host Jordan Peterson. This notable shift has coincided with Musk\u2019s growing support of conservative political causes. He criticized lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and has used social media to amplify his beliefs related to free speech. According to PBS , he has shared memes and sometimes misinformation on X about topics such as illegal immigration, alleged U.S. election fraud, and transgender policies. In broader terms, the boundless potential of space exploration and the preservation of the future of the human race have become the cornerstones of Musk\u2019s abiding interests, and toward these, he has founded the Musk Foundation, which is dedicated to space exploration and the discovery of renewable and clean energy sources. In October 2019, Musk pledged to donate $1 million to the #TeamTrees campaign, which aims to plant 20 million trees around the world by 2020. He even changed his Twitter name to Treelon for the occasion. Musk has also been vocal about his concerns over a looming world population collapse caused by lower birth rates, calling it a \u201cbigger risk to civilization than global warming.\u201d However, many demographers have disagreed with his assessment.

Where did Elon Musk go to school? Elon Musk went to Queen\u2019s University in Kingston, Ontario, Canada, and then transferred to the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, where he received bachelor\u2019s degrees in physics and economics in 1997. He began graduate school in physics at Stanford University but left after several days to focus on being an entrepreneur. What did Elon Musk accomplish? Elon Musk cofounded the electronic payment firm PayPal , and in 2002 he founded SpaceX , a company that makes rockets and spacecraft. He was a major early funder of Tesla , which makes electric cars and batteries, and became its chief executive officer in 2008. He cofounded Neuralink, a neurotechnology company, in 2016. Musk purchased the social media service Twitter in 2022 and renamed it X in 2023. Elon Musk (born June 28, 1971, Pretoria , South Africa) is a South African -born American entrepreneur who cofounded the electronic-payment firm PayPal and formed SpaceX , maker of launch vehicles and spacecraft . He was also one of the first significant investors in, as well as chief executive officer of, the electric car manufacturer Tesla . In addition, Musk acquired Twitter (later X) in 2022. Musk leads the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in U.S. Pres. Donald Trump \u2019s second administration . Musk is the world\u2019s richest person, with a net worth of $393 billion, as of 2025. Early life Musk was born to a South African father and a Canadian mother. He displayed an early talent for computers and entrepreneurship. At age 12 he created a video game and sold it to a computer magazine. In 1988, after obtaining a Canadian passport, Musk left South Africa because he was unwilling to support apartheid through compulsory military service and because he sought the greater economic opportunities available in the United States . PayPal and SpaceX Musk attended Queen\u2019s University in Kingston, Ontario, and in 1992 he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania , Philadelphia, where he received bachelor\u2019s degrees in physics and economics in 1997. He enrolled in graduate school in physics at Stanford University in California , but he left after only two days because he felt that the Internet had much more potential to change society than work in physics. In 1995 he founded Zip2 , a company that provided maps and business directories to online newspapers. In 1999 Zip2 was bought by the computer manufacturer Compaq for $307 million, and Musk then founded an online financial services company, X.com, which later became PayPal, which specialized in transferring money online. The online auction eBay bought PayPal in 2002 for $1.5 billion. What Do You Think? Should Humans Colonize Space? Explore the ProCon debate. Musk was long convinced that for life to survive, humanity has to become a multiplanet species. However, he was dissatisfied with the great expense of rocket launchers. In 2002 he founded Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) to make more affordable rockets. Its first two rockets were the Falcon 1 (first launched in 2006) and the larger Falcon 9 (first launched in 2010), which were designed to cost much less than competing rockets. A third rocket, the Falcon Heavy (first launched in 2018), was designed to carry 117,000 pounds (53,000 kg) to orbit, nearly twice as much as its largest competitor, the Boeing Company \u2019s Delta IV Heavy, for one-third the cost. The Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy eventually dominated the launch vehicle market, and in 2024 more than half of the world\u2019s orbital launches were done by SpaceX. Video released by spacecraft maker SpaceX celebrating its Dragon capsule, which on May 25, 2012, became the first commercial spacecraft to dock with the International Space Station. SpaceX ( A Britannica Publishing Partner ) SpaceX has announced the successor to the Falcon 9 and the Falcon Heavy: the Super Heavy\u2013Starship system. The Super Heavy first stage would be capable of lifting 100,000 kg (220,000 pounds) to low Earth orbit . The payload would be the Starship, a spacecraft designed for providing fast transportation between cities on Earth and building bases on the Moon and Mars. SpaceX also developed the Dragon spacecraft, which carries supplies to the International Space Station (ISS). Dragon can carry as many as seven astronauts, and it had a crewed flight carrying astronauts Doug Hurley and Robert Behnken to the ISS in 2020. The first test flights of the Super Heavy\u2013Starship system launched in 2020. In addition to being CEO of SpaceX, Musk was also chief designer in building the Falcon rockets, Dragon, and Starship. SpaceX is contracted to build the lander for the astronauts returning to the Moon by 2026 as part of NASA \u2019s Artemis space program. SpaceX has also developed the Starlink satellite\u00a0network, which provides\u00a0Internet\u00a0service. As of 2025 there are about 7,000 working Starlink satellites, accounting for more than half of all active satellites. Starlink is a megaconstellation , or satellite Internet\u00a0constellation, with more than three million subscribers as of 2024. Tesla Musk had long been interested in the possibilities of electric cars, and in 2004 he became one of the major funders of Tesla Motors (later renamed Tesla), an electric car company founded by entrepreneurs Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning . In 2006 Tesla introduced its first car, the Roadster , which could travel 245 miles (394 km) on a single charge. Unlike most previous electric vehicles, which Musk thought were stodgy and uninteresting, it was a sports car that could go from 0 to 60 miles (97 km) per hour in less than four seconds. In 2010 the company\u2019s initial public offering raised about $226 million. Two years later Tesla introduced the Model S sedan, which was acclaimed by automotive critics for its performance and design. The company won further praise for its Model X luxury SUV, which went on the market in 2015. The Model 3, a less-expensive vehicle, went into production in 2017 and became the best-selling electric car of all time. Open full sized image Elon Musk, 2014. Jerry Lampen\u2014EPA/Shutterstock.com Tesla announced several models to be released early in the 2020s, including a semitrailer\u00a0truck\u00a0(the Tesla Semi) and a pickup truck, the\u00a0Cybertruck. Although the Cybertruck was slated for production in 2021,\u00a0supply chain disruptions, design, and production issues pushed its rollout back two years. By the time Tesla began making Cybertruck deliveries in late 2023, it boasted a reservation backlog of two million vehicles, despite the boxy angular design that excited controversy when it was first unveiled. Dissatisfied with the projected cost ($68 billion) of a high-speed rail system in California, Musk in 2013 proposed an alternate faster system, the Hyperloop , a pneumatic tube in which a pod carrying 28 passengers would travel the 350 miles (560 km) between Los Angeles and San Francisco in 35 minutes at a top speed of 760 miles (1,220 km) per hour, nearly the speed of sound . Musk claimed that the Hyperloop would cost only $6 billion and that, with the pods departing every two minutes on average, the system could accommodate the six million people who travel that route every year. However, he stated, between running SpaceX and Tesla, he could not devote time to the Hyperloop\u2019s development. X (formerly Twitter ) What do you think? Does social media spur digital addiction and other ills? Explore the ProCon debate Musk joined the social media service Twitter in 2009, and, as @elonmusk, he became one of the most popular accounts on the site, with more than 85 million followers as of 2022. He expressed reservations about Tesla\u2019s being publicly traded, and in August 2018 he made a series of tweets about taking the company private at a value of $420 per share, noting that he had \u201csecured funding.\u201d (The value of $420 was seen as a joking reference to April 20, a day celebrated by devotees of cannabis .) The following month the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Musk for securities fraud, alleging that the tweets were \u201cfalse and misleading.\u201d Shortly thereafter Tesla\u2019s board rejected the SEC\u2019s proposed settlement, reportedly because Musk had threatened to resign. However, the news sent Tesla stock plummeting, and a harsher deal was ultimately accepted. Its terms included Musk\u2019s stepping down as chairman for three years, though he was allowed to continue as CEO; his tweets were to be preapproved by Tesla lawyers, and fines of $20 million for both Tesla and Musk were levied. Musk was critical of Twitter\u2019s commitment to principles of free speech , in light of the company\u2019s content-moderation policies. Early in April 2022, Twitter\u2019s filings with the SEC disclosed that Musk had bought more than 9 percent of the company. Shortly thereafter Twitter announced that Musk would join the company\u2019s board, but Musk decided against that and made a bid for the entire company, at a value of $54.20 a share, for $44 billion. Twitter\u2019s board accepted the deal, which would make him sole owner of the company. Musk stated that his plans for the company included \u201cenhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans.\u201d In July 2022 Musk announced that he was withdrawing his bid, stating that Twitter had not provided sufficient information about bot accounts and claiming that the company was in \u201cmaterial breach of multiple provisions\u201d of the purchase agreement. Bret Taylor, the chair of Twitter\u2019s board of directors, responded by saying that the company was \u201ccommitted to closing the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon with Mr. Musk.\u201d Twitter sued Musk to force him to buy the company. In September 2022 Twitter\u2019s shareholders voted to accept Musk\u2019s offer. Facing a legal battle, Musk ultimately proceeded with the deal, and it was completed in October. Among Musk\u2019s first acts as Twitter\u2019s owner were to lay off about half the company and to allow users to purchase for $8 a month the blue check-mark verification, which had previously been bestowed by Twitter upon notable figures. In addition, he disbanded Twitter\u2019s content-moderation body and reinstated many banned accounts, most notably that of former U.S. president Donald Trump , which had been suspended after the U.S. Capitol attack on January 6, 2021 . Advertising revenue fell sharply as many companies withdrew their ads from the platform. Musk changed the name of the company from Twitter to X in July 2023. (Tweets became posts with the change.) Politics and DOGE Musk had described himself as a \u201cmoderate Democrat,\u201d but his views became much more right-wing after his purchase of X. He publicly endorsed Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump after an assassination attempt on Trump in July 2024. Through his America Political Action Committee (PAC), he became the country\u2019s largest political donor, giving $288 million to Trump and other Republican candidates. Explore the individuals tapped for key government roles. Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc. Musk spoke at campaign rallies for Trump and through America PAC set up a sweepstakes in which he would pay $1 million a day through election day to one voter in a key swing state. The action prompted lawsuits alleging that it amounted to paying people to vote, which is illegal. Trump promised during his campaign that Musk and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy would lead a commission, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE, a reference to the cryptocurrency memecoin Dogecoin), charged with making the government more efficient. Musk vowed that in that effort, he would \u201cbalance the budget immediately\u201d by cutting $2 trillion in government spending, which would \u201cinvolve some temporary hardship.\u201d Ramaswamy left DOGE hours after Trump\u2019s inauguration on January 20, 2025. That same day Trump issued an executive order that set up DOGE inside the United States Digital Service, which was renamed the United States DOGE Service. The order also stated that each federal agency should have a team of at least four DOGE employees. Musk became a \u201cspecial government employee,\u201d a designation for someone who works for the government on a temporary basis. Many of those involved with DOGE are former or current employees of Musk\u2019s companies. DOGE immediately went to work. On the afternoon of January 20 a DOGE team took over the office of the director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), an agency that manages the federal civil service , and assumed control of key OPM databases. More than two million government employees were emailed a deferred resignation offer. It stated that they would not have to return to their offices if they resigned at the end of September 2025. (The subject line of the email, \u201cFork in the Road,\u201d was the same as one used in an email Musk sent in 2022, offering resignation to Twitter employees shortly after he took over the service.) DOGE gained access to databases at the Treasury Department\u2019s Bureau of the Fiscal Service, which disburses most of the government\u2019s payments. Musk announced on X that he and Trump would shut down the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), which administers foreign aid . Shortly thereafter USAID\u2019s website was taken down, most of USAID\u2019s 10,000 employees were placed on administrative leave, and programs around the world were suspended. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) announced that it would cut $4 billion of \u201cindirect costs,\u201d which support hospitals and universities of NIH grant recipients. The Institute of Education Sciences, the research division of the Department of Education, had most of its contracts canceled. DOGE\u2019s actions led to a flurry of lawsuits. Critics of DOGE said that it had precipitated a constitutional crisis, in which the executive branch was violating the separation of powers by not spending the money that Congress had appropriated for agencies such as USAID and NIH. However, Republicans, who controlled Congress, claimed there was nothing unusual in a new administration reviewing government spending.

He owns about 12% of Tesla excluding options, but has pledged more than half his shares as collateral for personal loans of up to $3.5 billion. In early 2024, a Delaware judge voided Musk's 2018 deal to receive options equaling an additional 9% of Tesla. Forbes has discounted the options by 50% pending Musk's appeal. SpaceX, founded in 2002, is worth $350 billion based on a private share sale during December 2024. Musk owns an estimated 42% stake. Musk bought Twitter in a $44 billion (enterprise value) deal during 2022. Forbes estimates that the social media company, which he renamed X, is worth nearly 70% less as of August 2024. Musk owns an estimated 54% of xAI, which he founded in 2023. Private investors valued the company at a reported $50 billion in November 2024.

'At some point, he'll be going back,' Trump says. Joey Garrison USA TODAY Hear this story WASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump said Monday he wants to keep Elon Musk at the White House for as long as he is willing to oversee the Department of Government Efficiency but suggested the billionaire tech entrepreneur's time could be nearing an end. \"I think he's been amazing, but I also think he's got a big company to run,\" Trump told reporters Monday in the Oval Office before signing an executive order targeting ticket-scalping at live events. \"And at some point, he's going to be going back. He wants to.\" Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX and a senior White House adviser, is working in the Trump administration as a \"special government employee,\" a designation for federal government employees who work 130 days or less during a calendar year . It would mean Musk's tenure wraps at the end of May if the White House follows the federal guidelines and his government status isn't changed. \"I'd keep him as long as I could keep him,\" Trump said. \"He's a very talented guy. You know, I love very smart people. And he's very smart, and he's done a good job.\" More: 'Playing favorites': Trump comes to rescue of Musk and Tesla amid DOGE backlash As the head of DOGE, Musk has steered the Trump administration's efforts to eliminate spending programs approved by Congress and lay off tens of thousands of federal workers in a push to drastically shrink the government. Democrats and other Musk critics argue his leading role in the White House has given the world's richest man dangerous access to policy decisions that raise an assortment of conflicts given SpaceX's billions in contracts with the federal government. The scope of Musk's influence is far wider than DOGE. Musk has turned into the most prominent face of the Trump administration other than Trump himself, using his enormous following on X to lay out White House policy, attending Cabinet meetings , facilitating the return of two astronauts from space , and last weekend visiting Wisconsin to campaign for the Trump-backed candidate in the state's Supreme Court election. Under a Day 1 executive order signed by Trump, DOGE is set to terminate after 18 months of operations on July 4, 2026, coinciding with the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence. Trump said his Cabinet secretaries will start performing the cost-cutting roles of DOGE after Musk leaves and DOGE closes down. \"At a certain point, I think it will end, but they have also gotten a big education,\" Trump said of his secretaries. \"There'll be a point at which the secretaries will be able to do this work and do it very, you know, as we say, with the scalpel, and that's what we want.\" More: 'This is a revolution': Musk shrugs off DOGE criticism, defends department Musk contributed nearly $300 million to boost Trump's 2024 presidential campaign and, according to the New York Times, has signaled plans to pump an additional $100 million into a group controlled by Trump's political operations. Musk's continued presence in the White House poses a potential political liability for Trump. Most Americans, 51%, hold negative views of the tech mogul, while only 39% have positive views, according to a national NBC News poll taken in March . As Musk has turned into a polarizing political figure, Tesla sales and stock have plummeted and Tesla facilities have become targets of vandalism and violence in acts the administration has called \"domestic terrorism.\" \"He's an American patriot, but the way he's been treated with Tesla is just terrible,\" Trump said. Musk, in an interview with Fox News last week , said it has been \"disadvantageous for me to be in the government, not advantageous,\" and that his \"companies are suffering because I'm in the government.\" When asked about the approaching end of his 130-day special government employee status, Musk said he believes he will achieve most of the work to reach his goal of cutting $1 trillion from the federal government. \"I think we will accomplish most of the work required to reduce the deficit by a trillion dollars within that time frame,\" Musk said.

Ad Feedback Elon Musk says he sold X to his AI company By Lisa Eadicicco , CNN 4 minute read Updated\n          6:36 PM EDT, Fri March 28, 2025 Link Copied! Follow: AI See your latest updates This photo illustration shows the X icon on a smartphone screen in Los Angeles, California, on July 31, 2023. Chris Delmas/AFP/Getty Images/File CNN \u2014 Elon Musk on Friday evening announced he has sold his social media company, X, to xAI, his artificial intelligence company. xAI will pay $45 billion for X, slightly more than Musk paid for it in 2022 , but the new deal includes $12 billion of debt. Musk wrote on his X account that the deal gives X a valuation of $33 billion. \u201cxAI and X\u2019s futures are intertwined,\u201d Musk said in a post on X . \u201cToday, we officially take the step to combine the data, models, compute, distribution and talent. This combination will unlock immense potential by blending xAI\u2019s advanced AI capability and expertise with X\u2019s massive reach.\u201d Musk didn\u2019t announce any immediate changes to X, although xAI\u2019s Grok chatbot is already integrated into the social media platform. Musk said that the combined platform will \u201cdeliver smarter, more meaningful experiences.\u201d He said the value of the combined company was $80 billion. Musk has made a slew of changes to the platform once known as Twitter since he purchased it in 2022, prompting some major advertisers to flee .  He laid off 80% of the company\u2019s staff, upended the platform\u2019s verification system and reinstated suspended accounts of White supremacists within months of the acquisition. While X\u2019s valuation is lower than what Musk paid for the social outlet, it\u2019s still a reversal of fortunes for the company. Investment firm Fidelity estimated in October that X was worth nearly 80% less than when Musk bought it. By December, X had recovered somewhat but was still worth only around 30% of what Musk paid, according to Fidelity, whose Blue Chip fund holds a stake in X. The news also comes as Musk has been in the spotlight for his role at the Department of Government Efficiency in the Trump administration, which has raised questions about how much attention he\u2019s paying to his companies , particularly Tesla. Combining X and xAI could allow Musk to streamline his efforts. Musk has also been working to establish himself as a leader in the AI space, a big focus for both the Trump administration and the tech industry. Earlier this year, he led a group of investors attempting to purchase ChatGPT maker OpenAI for nearly $100 billion , another escalation in the longtime rivalry between Musk and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. It\u2019s unclear precisely how the acquisition will benefit Musk\u2019s AI ambitions. But the tighter integration with X could allow xAI to push its latest AI models and features to a broad audience more quickly. A significant reversal of X\u2019s fortunes Big advertisers, who had largely abandoned X after hate speech surged on the platform and ads were seen running alongside pro-Nazi content, have begun to return. (X made several pro-Nazi accounts ineligible for ads following advertiser departures.) Amazon and Apple are both reportedly reinvesting in X campaigns again, a remarkable endorsement from two brands with mass appeal. The brand\u2019s stabilization helped a group of bondholders, who had been deep underwater in their investments, sell billions of dollars in their X debt holdings at 97 cents on the dollar earlier this month \u2014 albeit with exceedingly high interest rates \u2014 according to several recent reports . Bloomberg in February reported that X was in talks to raise money that would value the company at $44 billion. It\u2019s not clear what came of those talks and why xAI is valuing X at less than it could reportedly fetch from investors. X needs to pay down its massive debt load, which Musk on Friday said totals $12 billion. A big part of why X\u2019s valuation has rebounded in recent months is xAI, which X reportedly held a stake in. Last month, xAI was seeking a $75 billion valuation in a funding round, according to Bloomberg . But the biggest factor in X\u2019s stunning bounce-back is almost certainly Musk himself: Musk\u2019s elevation to a special government employee under President Donald Trump has empowered the world\u2019s richest person with large sway over the operations of the federal government, which he has rapidly sought to reshape. Investors betting on X are probably making a gamble on its leader, not its business. Last year, Musk turned X into a pro-Trump machine, using the platform to boost the president\u2019s campaign . In posts to his 200 million followers, he pushed racist conspiracy theories about the Biden administration\u2019s immigration policies and obsessed over the \u201cwoke mind virus,\u201d a term used by some conservatives to describe progressive causes. And now, with Trump back in office and Musk working in the executive branch, X has once again become the most important social media platform for following and interacting with the Trump administration. Musk has also used X to broadcast some of his changes with his Department of Government Efficiency. This story has been updated with additional context and developments.

The boss of X (formerly Twitter), Tesla and SpaceX is the world's richest person and has used his platform to make his views known on a vast array of topics. He has charged ahead with human brain chip trials at his firm Neuralink, with three patients currently with implants. He's also played with turning X into a super app and tried to cement his presence in the fast-growing world of artificial intelligence , despite having warned it could lead to humanity's extinction . And Mr Musk's reach has expanded further still, after Donald Trump's victory in the 2024 US presidential election - in which the Tesla executive played a key but controversial role. The president picked the self-proclaimed \"first buddy\" to lead the newly created Department of Government Efficiency (or Doge - a nod to Musk's favourite cryptocurrency, Dogecoin). Musk has denied a \"hostile takeover\" of the government as his agency, which is not an official government department, implements cuts such as dismantling the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), which distributes tens of billions of dollars' worth of overseas aid every year. Experts have warned of a threat to global health following the move, which could see USAID staff slashed from about 10,000 to fewer than 300 globally . Trump has said Doge would help the administration \"dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures and restructure Federal Agencies\". It's something Mr Musk has experience of - he cut a huge number of jobs at Twitter, now X, after buying it. Trump picks Musk to advise on how to 'dismantle' bureaucracy After bursting on to the Silicon Valley scene more than two decades ago, the 53-year-old serial entrepreneur kept the public captivated with his business antics - although his more recent interventions in politics have not been very popular in the UK or Germany. In the UK, Musk accused Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer of being \"deeply complicit\" in grooming gang \"mass rapes in exchange for votes\" - while Sir Keir accused critics of \"spreading lies and misinformation\". In Germany, Musk has endorsed the far-right Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD), and urged Germans to back the party in forthcoming elections. In the UK and Germany, 71% of people said they took a negative view of Musk, with 63% saying they don't think he has much knowledge of national issues, according to YouGov . Where was Elon Musk born? Born in Pretoria, South Africa, Mr Musk showed his talents for entrepreneurship early, going door-to-door with his brother selling homemade chocolate Easter eggs and developing his first computer game at the age of 12. He has described his childhood as difficult, affected by his parents' divorce, bullying at school and his own difficulty picking up on social cues because of Asperger's Syndrome. At the earliest opportunity, he left home for college, moving to Canada and then the US, where he studied economics and physics at the University of Pennsylvania, an Ivy League college. In a 2010 essay for Marie Claire , his first wife, Justine Musk, a writer whom he met in college and married in 2000, wrote that even before making his millions Mr Musk was \"not a man who takes no for an answer\". \"The will to compete and dominate, that made him so successful in business, did not magically shut off when he came home,\" she recalled, adding that he told her while dancing at their wedding, \"I am the alpha in this relationship.\" How did Elon Musk make his money? After being accepted to a physics graduate degree programme at Stanford University, Mr Musk quickly dropped out and founded two technology start-ups during the \"dotcom boom\" of the 1990s. These included a web software firm and an online banking company that eventually became PayPal, which was sold to eBay in 2002 for $1.5bn (\u00a31.2bn). He ploughed his fortune into a new rocket company, SpaceX - which he aimed to make a cost-effective alternative to Nasa - and a new electric car company, Tesla, where he chaired the board until becoming chief executive in 2008. Getty Images Elon Musk in 2004, soon after starting SpaceX The two firms are credited with upending their industries, even as they sometimes veered close to financial collapse. More recent business ventures include his takeover of social media platform Twitter in October 2022. He dramatically reduced the size of its workforce including, controversially, cuts to teams responsible for keeping the platform safe; rebranded the company as X; and introduced new premium subscriptions so that the business did not rely on advertising alone for income. Mr Musk's long-term ambition is for X to become an \"everything app\" offering a range of services. However, so far the value of the firm has plunged from the $44bn he originally paid to just $9.4bn, according to some estimates. Since Mr Musk's takeover companies have been choosing to leave the platform in what's been termed \"the great X-odus\". Reports suggest hate speech has been growing under Mr Musk's X tenure , and some firms don't want to be associated with that. Leaving X can be a tricky decision for brands He also has ambitions in the AI sector, being an early investor in ChatGPT's parent company before parting ways in 2018, and setting up his own company xAI \"to understand the true nature of the universe\" in 2023. In February 2024, he sued OpenAI and its boss Sam Altman , saying the firm he helped found had reneged on its non-profit, open source origins by hitching its wagon to Microsoft. A year later, Musk led a takeover bid which was firmly rejected by Altman , who suggested a $9.74bn counter-offer for X. \"I'm never hugely convinced that he knows what he wants to do tomorrow,\" says journalist Chris Stokel-Walker of Mr Musk's wide-ranging interests. \"He very much leads by instinct.\" In a 2015 biography, author Ashlee Vance described Mr Musk as \"a confrontational know-it-all\" with an \"abundant ego\". But he also called him an awkward dancer and diffident public speaker. In the press, he's been dubbed both a mad genius and Twitter's biggest troll - known as much for his lofty ambitions as his petty fights, not to mention the more serious lawsuits he and his companies have faced from regulators, investors and others over issues such as racial discrimination and the trustworthiness of his claims. Divorced three times - twice from the same woman, British actress Talulah Riley - Mr Musk is frank about his faults. \"If you list my sins, I sound like the worst person on Earth,\" Mr Musk said in a TED interview in 2022 . \"But if you put those against the things I've done right, it makes much more sense.\" What is Elon Musk's net worth? Those contradictions certainly haven't stopped him amassing a fortune. According to Bloomberg's index tracking the wealth of the world's billionaires, Mr Musk is the richest of them all. It estimates his current net worth to be around $379bn, with his fortune soaring alongside Tesla's share price following Trump's election victory. That's based largely on the value of his shares in Tesla, of which he owns more than 13%. The company's stock soared in value - some say unreasonably - in 2020 as the firm's output increased and it started to deliver regular profits. The shares plunged at the end of 2022, with some blaming the distraction of the Twitter takeover for the fall, though they have since recovered a lot of ground. And throughout 2024 Mr Musk was locked in a legal battle over a $56bn pay package from Tesla with a Delaware judge rejecting his claim to it for a second time in December . Judge Kathaleen McCormick called the pay-out an \"unfathomable sum\", and argued Mr Musk had influenced the company's board and shareholders - with 75% of them voting to back his pay deal in June . Is Elon Musk worth his Tesla pay package? Getty Images Elon Musk and his son X \u00c6 A-12 in 2021. Mr Musk, who has had 12 children, has called \"population collapse\" a bigger risk than global warming Mr Musk also champions digital currencies and has a hand in several other smaller companies, including tunnel-maker the Boring Company. Mr Musk, who wears the mantle of a workaholic proudly, has often said he's not in business simply to make money - claims he repeated recently with regard to his Twitter takeover. \"Elon only gets involved with things if he feels that they're critically important for some reason... for the sake of society or humanity,\" says friend and Tesla investor Ross Gerber. Why does Elon Musk support Trump? For a long time Mr Musk, who became a US citizen in 2002, resisted efforts to label his politics - calling himself \"half-Democrat, half-Republican\", \"politically moderate\" and \"independent\". He says he voted for Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and - reluctantly - Joe Biden, all of them Democrats. But in recent years he's swung behind Donald Trump, who is a Republican. Musk told media company the Daily Wire his transgender daughter was \"killed\" by transitioning, and that he \"vowed to destroy the woke mind virus\". He is now estranged from his daughter. Musk officially endorsed Trump for a second term in 2024 after his attempted assassination and became one of the campaign's foremost backers and influencers. He became critical of the Democrat party's stance on a number of issues, including the economy, immigration and gun control - decrying many of its policies as \"woke\". Mr Musk also repeatedly claimed that freedom of speech, enshrined in the first amendment of the US Constitution, would be under threat with another Democrat government. He appeared at several Republican rallies in the run-up to the election, raised millions to fund a political action committee to help re-elect Trump, and frequently voiced his support for Trump in posts on X. Mr Musk's America Super PAC also ran a controversial $1m giveaway to voters in battleground states in the last weeks of the campaign. Why tech bros are backing Trump It was far from his first political controversy. He has shared controversial takes on X about issues facing countries worldwide, such as suggesting the UK was on the cusp of \"civil war\" amid violent unrest in August 2024. While Mr Musk provided his Starlink satellite internet service to Ukraine, he also attracted criticism for refusing an emergency request from Kyiv to activate Starlink in Sevastopol, home to a major Russian navy port . In the US, he moved to Texas, complaining of California's regulations and high taxes; has clashed with union organisers; and, in the spring of 2020, decried coronavirus lockdowns as \"fascist\". Getty Images Elon Musk at the opening party for the Tesla gigafactory in Austin, Texas In the past he has said that he sees his businesses as a form of philanthropy, because they are focused on solving major human issues, such as climate change in the case of Tesla. However, he has since moderated his views on climate change, tweeting it is \"real, just much slower than alarmists claim\". Despite his own interest in artificial intelligence, he has also been one of the most prominent figures expressing concern about the supposed threat to humanity's future that super-intelligent AIs might pose. He has claimed that the rise of artificial intelligence, combined with a declining birth rate, could result in \"not enough people\" being in the world. Mr Musk has had 12 children - six with his first wife, three with Canadian singer Grimes, and three with Shivon Zilis. Following the birth of his twins with Ms Zilis, he tweeted : \"Doing my best to help the underpopulation crisis.\" Additional reporting by Liv McMahon Is Elon Musk worth his \u00a344bn Tesla pay package?

February 11, 1731] [ a ] \u2013 December 14 , 1799) was a Founding Father and the first president of the United States , serving from 1789 to 1797. As commander of the Continental Army , Washington led Patriot forces to victory in the American Revolutionary War against the British Empire . He is commonly known as the Father of His Country for his role in bringing about American independence . Born in the Colony of Virginia , Washington became the commander of the Virginia Regiment during the French and Indian War (1754\u20131763). He was later elected to the Virginia House of Burgesses , and opposed the perceived oppression of the American colonists by the British Crown. When the American Revolutionary War against the British began in 1775, Washington was appointed commander-in-chief of the Continental Army . He directed a poorly organized and equipped force against disciplined British troops. Washington and his army achieved an early victory at the Siege of Boston in March 1776 but were forced to retreat from New York City in November. Washington crossed the Delaware River and won the battles of Trenton in late 1776 and Princeton in early 1777, then lost the battles of Brandywine and Germantown later that year. He faced criticism of his command, low troop morale, and a lack of provisions for his forces as the war continued. Ultimately Washington led a combined French and American force to a decisive victory over the British at Yorktown in 1781. In the resulting Treaty of Paris in 1783, the British acknowledged the sovereign independence of the United States. Washington then served as president of the Constitutional Convention in 1787, which drafted the current Constitution of the United States . Washington was elected president unanimously by the Electoral College in 1788 and 1792. As the first U.S. president, he implemented a strong, well-financed national government while remaining impartial in the fierce rivalry that emerged within his cabinet between Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton . During the French Revolution , he proclaimed a policy of neutrality while supporting the Jay Treaty with Britain. Washington set enduring precedents for the office of president , including republicanism , a peaceful transfer of power , the use of the title \" Mr. President \", and the two-term tradition . His 1796 farewell address became a preeminent statement on republicanism: Washington wrote about the importance of national unity and the dangers that regionalism, partisanship, and foreign influence pose to it. As a planter of tobacco and wheat at Mount Vernon , Washington owned many slaves . He began opposing slavery near the end of his life, and provided in his will for the manumission of his slaves. Washington's image is an icon of American culture and he has been extensively memorialized ; his namesakes include the national capital and the State of Washington . In both popular and scholarly polls, he is consistently considered one of the greatest presidents in American history.

[ 3 ] He was the first of six children of Augustine and Mary Ball Washington . [ 4 ] His father was a justice of the peace and a prominent public figure who had four additional children from his first marriage to Jane Butler. [ 5 ] Washington was not close to his father and rarely mentioned him in later years; he had a fractious relationship with his mother. [ 6 ] Among his siblings, he was particularly close to his older half-brother Lawrence . [ 7 ] The family moved to a plantation on Little Hunting Creek in 1735 before settling at Ferry Farm near Fredericksburg, Virginia , in 1738. When Augustine died in 1743, Washington inherited Ferry Farm and ten slaves; Lawrence inherited Little Hunting Creek and renamed it Mount Vernon . [ 8 ] Because of his father's death, Washington did not have the formal education his elder half-brothers had received at Appleby Grammar School in England; he instead attended the Lower Church School in Hartfield . He learned mathematics and land surveying , and became a talented draftsman and mapmaker . By early adulthood, he was writing with what his biographer Ron Chernow described as \"considerable force\" and \"precision\". [ 9 ] As a teenager, Washington compiled over a hundred rules for social interaction styled The Rules of Civility , copied from an English translation of a French guidebook. [ 10 ] Washington often visited Belvoir , the plantation of William Fairfax , Lawrence's father-in-law, and Mount Vernon. Fairfax became Washington's patron and surrogate father. In 1748, Washington spent a month with a team surveying Fairfax's Shenandoah Valley property. [ 11 ] The following year, he received a surveyor's license from the College of William & Mary . [ b ] Even though Washington had not served the customary apprenticeship , Thomas Fairfax (William's cousin) appointed him surveyor of Culpeper County, Virginia . Washington took his oath of office on July 20, 1749, and resigned in 1750. [ 12 ] By 1752, he had bought almost 1,500 acres (600\u00a0ha) in the Shenandoah Valley and owned 2,315 acres (937\u00a0ha). [ 13 ] In 1751, Washington left mainland North America for the first and only time, when he accompanied Lawrence to Barbados , hoping the climate would cure his brother's tuberculosis . [ 14 ] Washington contracted smallpox during the trip, which left his face slightly scarred. [ 15 ] Lawrence died in 1752, and Washington leased Mount Vernon from his widow, Anne; he inherited it outright after her death in 1761. [ 16 ] Colonial military career (1752\u20131758) Lawrence Washington's service as adjutant general of the Virginia militia inspired George to seek a militia commission . Virginia's lieutenant governor, Robert Dinwiddie , appointed Washington as a major and commander of one of the four militia districts. The British and French were competing for control of the Ohio River Valley : the British were constructing forts along the river, and the French between the river and Lake Erie . [ 17 ] In October 1753, Dinwiddie appointed Washington as a special envoy to demand the French forces vacate land that was claimed by the British. Washington was also directed to make peace with the Iroquois Confederacy and to gather intelligence about the French forces. [ 18 ] Washington met with Iroquois leader Tanacharison at Logstown . [ 19 ] Washington said that at this meeting Tanacharison named him Conotocaurius . This name, meaning \"devourer of villages\", had previously been given to his great-grandfather John Washington in the late 17th century by the Susquehannock . [ 20 ] Washington's party reached the Ohio River in November 1753 and was intercepted by a French patrol. The party was escorted to Fort Le Boeuf , where Washington was received in a friendly manner. He delivered the British demand to vacate to the French commander Jacques Legardeur de Saint-Pierre , but the French refused to leave. Saint-Pierre gave Washington his official answer after a few days' delay, as well as food and winter clothing for his party's journey back to Virginia. [ 21 ] Washington completed the precarious mission in difficult winter conditions, achieving a measure of distinction when his report was published in Virginia and London. [ 22 ] French and Indian War Main article: George Washington in the French and Indian War Map showing key locations in the French and Indian War Washington the Soldier , an 1834 portrait of Washington on horseback during the Battle of the Monongahela In February 1754, Dinwiddie promoted Washington to lieutenant colonel and second-in-command of the 300-strong Virginia Regiment , with orders to confront the French at the Forks of the Ohio . [ 23 ] Washington set out with half the regiment in April and was soon aware that a French force of 1,000 had begun construction of Fort Duquesne there. In May, having established a defensive position at Great Meadows, Washington learned that the French had made camp seven miles (11\u00a0km) away; he decided to take the offensive. [ 24 ] The French detachment proved to be only about 50 men, so on May 28 Washington commanded an ambush . His small force of Virginians and Indian allies [ c ] [ 26 ] killed the French, including their commander Joseph Coulon de Jumonville , who had been carrying a diplomatic message for the British. The French later found their countrymen dead and scalped , blaming Washington, who had retreated to Fort Necessity . [ 27 ] The rest of the Virginia Regiment joined Washington the following month with news that he had been promoted to the rank of colonel and given command of the full regiment. They were reinforced by an independent company of a hundred South Carolinians led by Captain James Mackay ; his royal commission outranked Washington's and a conflict of command ensued. On July 3, 900 French soldiers attacked Fort Necessity, and the ensuing battle ended in Washington's surrender. [ 28 ] Washington did not speak French, but signed a surrender document in which he unwittingly took responsibility for \"assassinating\" Jumonville, later blaming the translator for not properly translating it. [ 29 ] The Virginia Regiment was divided and Washington was offered a captaincy in one of the newly formed regiments. He refused, as it would have been a demotion\u2014the British had ordered that \"colonials\" could not be ranked any higher than captain\u2014and instead resigned his commission. [ 30 ] [ 31 ] The Jumonville affair became the incident which ignited the French and Indian War . [ 32 ] In 1755, Washington volunteered as an aide to General Edward Braddock , who led a British expedition to expel the French from Fort Duquesne and the Ohio Country . [ 33 ] On Washington's recommendation, Braddock split the army into one main column and a smaller \"flying column\". [ 34 ] Washington was suffering from severe dysentery so did not initially travel with the expedition forces. When he rejoined Braddock at Monongahela, still very ill, the French and their Indian allies ambushed the divided army. Two-thirds of the British force became casualties in the ensuing Battle of the Monongahela , and Braddock was killed. Under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Gage , Washington rallied the survivors and formed a rear guard , allowing the remnants of the force to retreat. [ 35 ] During the engagement, Washington had two horses shot out from under him, and his hat and coat were pierced by bullets. [ 36 ] His conduct redeemed his reputation among critics of his command in the Battle of Fort Necessity, [ 37 ] but he was not included by the succeeding commander (Colonel Thomas Dunbar) in planning subsequent operations. [ 38 ] The Virginia Regiment was reconstituted in August 1755, and Dinwiddie appointed Washington its commander, again with the rank of colonel. Washington clashed over seniority almost immediately, this time with Captain John Dagworthy , who commanded a detachment of Marylanders at the regiment's headquarters in Fort Cumberland . [ 39 ] Washington, impatient for an offensive against Fort Duquesne, was convinced Braddock would have granted him a royal commission and pressed his case in February 1756 with Braddock's successor as Commander-in-Chief , William Shirley , and again in January 1757 with Shirley's successor, Lord Loudoun . Loudoun humiliated Washington, refused him a royal commission, and agreed only to relieve him of the responsibility of manning Fort Cumberland. [ 40 ] In 1758, the Virginia Regiment was assigned to the British Forbes Expedition to capture Fort Duquesne. [ 41 ] [ 31 ] General John Forbes took Washington's advice on some aspects of the expedition but rejected his opinion on the best route to the fort. [ 42 ] Forbes nevertheless made Washington a brevet brigadier general and gave him command of one of the three brigades that was assigned to assault the fort. The French had abandoned the fort and the valley before the assault, however, and Washington only saw a friendly fire incident which left 14 dead and 26 injured. Frustrated, he resigned his commission soon afterwards and returned to Mount Vernon. [ 43 ] Under Washington, the Virginia Regiment had defended 300 miles (480\u00a0km) of frontier against twenty Indian attacks in ten months. [ 44 ] He increased the professionalism of the regiment as it grew from 300 to 1,000 men. Though he failed to realize a royal commission, which made him hostile towards the British, [ 31 ] he gained self-confidence, leadership skills, and knowledge of British military tactics. The destructive competition Washington witnessed among colonial politicians fostered his later support of a strong central government. [ 45 ] Marriage, civilian and political life (1759\u20131775) Main article: George Washington's political evolution Colonel George Washington , a 1772 portrait of Washington by Charles Willson Peale Martha Dandridge Custis , a 1757 portrait of Martha Washington by John Wollaston On January 6, 1759, Washington, at age 26, married Martha Dandridge Custis , the 27-year-old widow of wealthy plantation owner Daniel Parke Custis . Martha was intelligent, gracious, and experienced in managing a planter's estate, and the couple had a happy marriage. [ 46 ] They lived at Mount Vernon, where Washington cultivated tobacco and wheat. [ 47 ] The marriage gave Washington control over Martha's one-third dower interest in the 18,000-acre (7,300\u00a0ha) Custis estate , and he managed the remaining two-thirds for Martha's children. As a result, he became one of the wealthiest men in Virginia, which increased his social standing. [ 48 ] At Washington's urging, Governor Lord Botetourt fulfilled Dinwiddie's 1754 promise to grant land bounties to those who served with volunteer militias during the French and Indian War. [ 49 ] In late 1770, Washington inspected the lands in the Ohio and Great Kanawha regions, and he engaged surveyor William Crawford to subdivide it. Crawford allotted 23,200 acres (9,400\u00a0ha) to Washington, who told the veterans that their land was unsuitable for farming and agreed to purchase 20,147 acres (8,153\u00a0ha), leaving some feeling that they had been duped. [ 50 ] He also doubled the size of Mount Vernon to 6,500 acres (2,600\u00a0ha) and, by 1775, had more than doubled its slave population to over one hundred. [ 51 ] As a respected military hero and large landowner, Washington held local offices and was elected to the Virginia provincial legislature, representing Frederick County in the Virginia House of Burgesses for seven years beginning in 1758. [ d ] [ 51 ] Early in his legislative career, Washington rarely spoke at or even attended legislative sessions, but was more politically active starting in the 1760s, becoming a prominent critic of Britain's taxation and mercantilist policies towards the American colonies. [ 53 ] Washington imported luxury goods from England, paying for them by exporting tobacco. His profligate spending combined with low tobacco prices left him \u00a31,800 in debt by 1764. [ 54 ] Washington's complete reliance on London tobacco buyer and merchant Robert Cary also threatened his economic security. [ e ] [ 56 ] Between 1764 and 1766, he sought to diversify his holdings: he changed Mount Vernon's primary cash crop from tobacco to wheat and expanded operations to include flour milling and hemp farming . [ 57 ] Washington's stepdaughter Patsy suffered from epileptic attacks, and she died at Mount Vernon in 1773, allowing Washington to use part of the inheritance from her estate to settle his debts. [ 58 ] Opposition to the British Parliament and Crown Further information: American Revolution and George Washington in the American Revolution Washington was opposed to the taxes which the British Parliament imposed on the Colonies without proper representation . [ 59 ] He believed the Stamp Act 1765 was oppressive and celebrated its repeal the following year. In response to the Townshend Acts , he introduced a proposal in May 1769 which urged Virginians to boycott British goods; the Townshend Acts were mostly repealed in 1770. [ 60 ] Washington and other colonists were also angered by the Royal Proclamation of 1763 (which banned American settlement west of the Allegheny Mountains ) [ 61 ] and British interference in American western land speculation (in which Washington was a participant). [ 62 ] Parliament sought to punish Massachusetts colonists for their role in the Boston Tea Party in 1774 by passing the Coercive Acts , which Washington saw as \"an invasion of our rights and privileges\". [ 63 ] That July, he and George Mason drafted a list of resolutions for the Fairfax County committee, including a call to end the Atlantic slave trade ; the resolutions were adopted. [ 64 ] In August, Washington attended the First Virginia Convention and was selected as a delegate to the First Continental Congress . [ 65 ] As tensions rose in 1774, he helped train militias in Virginia and organized enforcement of the Continental Association boycott of British goods instituted by the Congress. [ 66 ] Commander in chief of the army (1775\u20131783) Further information: Military career of George Washington General Washington, Commander of the Continental Army , a 1776 portrait by Charles Willson Peale The American Revolutionary War broke out on April 19, 1775 with the Battles of Lexington and Concord . [ 67 ] Washington hastily departed Mount Vernon on May 4 to join the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia . [ 68 ] On June 14, Congress created the Continental Army and John Adams nominated Washington as its commander-in-chief , mainly because of his military experience and the belief that a Virginian would better unite the colonies. He was unanimously elected by Congress the next day. [ f ] [ 70 ] Washington gave an acceptance speech on June 16, declining a salary, though he was later reimbursed expenses. [ 71 ] Congress chose Washington's primary staff officers, including Artemas Ward , Horatio Gates , Charles Lee , Philip Schuyler , and Nathanael Greene . [ 72 ] Henry Knox impressed Adams and Washington with his knowledge of ordnance and was promoted to colonel and chief of artillery. Similarly, Washington was impressed by Alexander Hamilton 's intelligence and bravery; he would later promote Hamilton to colonel and appoint him his aide-de-camp . [ 73 ] Washington initially banned the enlistment of Black soldiers, both free and enslaved. The British saw an opportunity to divide the colonies: the colonial governor of Virginia issued a proclamation promising freedom to slaves if they joined the British forces. [ 74 ] In response to this proclamation and the need for troops, Washington soon overturned his ban. [ 75 ] By the end of the war, around one-tenth of the soldiers in the Continental Army were Black, with some obtaining freedom. [ 76 ] Siege of Boston Main article: Siege of Boston In April 1775, in response to the growing rebellious movement, British troops occupied Boston , led by General Thomas Gage , commander of British forces in America. [ 77 ] Local militias surrounded the city and trapped the British troops, resulting in a standoff. [ 78 ] As Washington headed for Boston, he was greeted by cheering crowds and political ceremony; he became a symbol of the Patriot cause. [ 79 ] Upon Washington's arrival on July 2, he went to inspect the army, but found undisciplined militia. [ 80 ] After consultation, he initiated Benjamin Franklin 's suggested reforms, instituting military drills and imposing strict disciplinary measures. [ 81 ] Washington promoted some of the soldiers who had performed well at Bunker Hill to officer rank, and removed officers who he saw as incompetent. [ 82 ] In October, King George III declared that the colonies were in open rebellion and relieved Gage of command, replacing him with General William Howe . [ 83 ] When the Charles River froze over, Washington was eager to cross and storm Boston, but Gates and others were opposed to having untrained militia attempt to assault well-garrisoned fortifications. Instead, Washington agreed to secure the Dorchester Heights above Boston to try to force the British out. [ 84 ] On March 17, 8,906 British troops, 1,100 Loyalists , and 1,220 women and children began a chaotic naval evacuation. Washington entered the city with 500 men, giving them explicit orders not to plunder. [ 85 ] He refrained from exerting military authority in Boston, leaving civilian matters in the hands of local authorities. [ g ] [ 88 ] New York and New Jersey Main article: New York and New Jersey Campaign Battle of Long Island Main article: Battle of Long Island Map of the Battle of Long Island After the victory at Boston, Washington correctly guessed that the British would return to New York City and retaliate. He arrived there on April 13, 1776, and ordered the construction of fortifications. He also ordered his forces to treat civilians and their property with respect, to avoid the abuses Bostonians suffered at the hands of British troops. [ 89 ] The British forces, including more than a hundred ships and thousands of troops, began arriving on Staten Island in July to lay siege to the city. [ 90 ] Howe's troop strength totaled 32,000 regulars and Hessian auxiliaries ; Washington had 23,000 men, mostly untrained recruits and militia. [ 91 ] In August, Howe landed 20,000 troops at Gravesend, Brooklyn , and approached Washington's fortifications. Overruling his generals, Washington chose to fight, based on inaccurate information that Howe's army had only around 8,000 soldiers. [ 92 ] In the Battle of Long Island , Howe assaulted Washington's flank and inflicted 1,500 Patriot casualties. [ 93 ] Washington retreated to Manhattan . [ 94 ] Howe sent a message to Washington to negotiate peace, addressing him as \"George Washington, Esq.\" Washington declined to accept the message, demanding to be addressed with diplomatic protocol\u2014not as a rebel. [ 95 ] Despite misgivings, Washington heeded the advice of General Greene to defend Fort Washington , but was ultimately forced to abandon it. [ 96 ] Howe pursued and Washington retreated across the Hudson River to Fort Lee . In November, Howe captured Fort Washington . Loyalists in New York City considered Howe a liberator and spread a rumor that Washington had set fire to the city. [ 97 ] Now reduced to 5,400 troops, Washington's army retreated through New Jersey . [ 98 ] Crossing the Delaware, Trenton, and Princeton Main articles: George Washington's crossing of the Delaware River , Battle of Trenton , and Battle of Princeton Washington Crossing the Delaware by Emanuel Leutze (1851) Washington crossed the Delaware River into Pennsylvania , where General John Sullivan joined him with 2,000 more troops. [ 99 ] The future of the Continental Army was in doubt due to a lack of supplies, a harsh winter, expiring enlistments, and desertions . [ 100 ] Howe posted a Hessian garrison at Trenton to hold western New Jersey and the east shore of the Delaware. [ 101 ] At sunrise on December 26, 1776, Washington, aided by Colonel Knox and artillery, led his men in a successful surprise attack on the Hessians . [ 102 ] Washington returned to New Jersey on January 3, 1777, launching an attack on the British regulars at Princeton , with 40 Americans killed or wounded and 273 British killed or captured. [ 103 ] Howe retreated to New York City for the winter. [ 104 ] Washington took up winter headquarters in Morristown, New Jersey . [ 105 ] Strategically, Washington's victories at Trenton and Princeton were pivotal: they revived Patriot morale and quashed the British strategy of showing overwhelming force followed by offering generous terms, changing the course of the war. [ 106 ] Philadelphia Main article: Philadelphia campaign Brandywine, Germantown, and Saratoga Main articles: Battle of Brandywine , Battle of Germantown , and Battles of Saratoga In July 1777, the British general John Burgoyne led his British troops south from Quebec in the Saratoga campaign ; he recaptured Fort Ticonderoga , intending to divide New England . However, General Howe took his army from New York City south to Philadelphia rather than joining Burgoyne near Albany . [ 107 ] Washington and Gilbert, Marquis de Lafayette rushed to Philadelphia to engage Howe. In the Battle of Brandywine on September 11, 1777, Howe outmaneuvered Washington and marched unopposed into the American capital at Philadelphia. A Patriot attack against the British at Germantown in October failed. [ 108 ] In Upstate New York , the Patriots were led by General Horatio Gates. Concerned about Burgoyne's movements southward, Washington sent reinforcements north with Generals Benedict Arnold and Benjamin Lincoln . On October 7, 1777, Burgoyne tried to take Bemis Heights but was isolated from support and forced to surrender. Gates' victory emboldened Washington's critics, who favored Gates as a military leader. [ 109 ] According to the biographer John Alden, \"It was inevitable that the defeats of Washington's forces and the concurrent victory of the forces in upper New York should be compared.\" [ 110 ] Admiration for Washington was waning. [ 111 ] Valley Forge and Monmouth Main articles: Valley Forge and Battle of Monmouth Washington and Lafayette at Valley Forge , a 1907 painting by John Ward Dunsmore Washington and his army of 11,000 men went into winter quarters at Valley Forge north of Philadelphia in December 1777. There they lost between 2,000 and 3,000 men as a result of disease and lack of food, clothing, and shelter, reducing the army to below 9,000 men. [ 112 ] By February, Washington was facing low troop morale and increased desertions. [ 113 ] An internal revolt by his officers prompted some members of Congress to consider removing Washington from command. Washington's supporters resisted, and the matter was ultimately dropped. [ 114 ] Washington made repeated petitions to Congress for provisions and expressed the urgency of the situation to a congressional delegation. [ 115 ] Congress agreed to strengthen the army's supply lines and reorganize the quartermaster and commissary departments, while Washington launched the Grand Forage of 1778 [ h ] to collect food from the surrounding region. [ 116 ] Meanwhile, Baron Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben 's incessant drilling transformed Washington's recruits into a disciplined fighting force. [ 117 ] Washington appointed him Inspector General . [ 118 ] In early 1778, the French entered into a Treaty of Alliance with the Americans. [ 119 ] In May, Howe resigned and was replaced by Sir Henry Clinton . [ 120 ] The British evacuated Philadelphia for New York that June and Washington summoned a war council of American and French generals. He chose to order a limited strike on the retreating British. Generals Lee and Lafayette moved with 4,000 men, without Washington's knowledge, and bungled their first strike on June 28. Washington relieved Lee and achieved a draw after an expansive battle . The British continued their retreat to New York. [ 121 ] This battle \"marked the end of the war's campaigning in the northern and middle states. Washington would not fight the British in a major engagement again for more than three years\". [ 122 ] British attention shifted to the Southern theatre; in late 1778, General Clinton captured Savannah, Georgia , a key port in the American South. [ 123 ] Washington, meanwhile, ordered an expedition against the Iroquois , the Indigenous allies of the British, destroying their villages. [ 124 ] Espionage and West Point Main articles: Culper Ring and Military career of Benedict Arnold, 1777\u20131779 Washington became America's first spymaster by designing an espionage system against the British. [ 125 ] In 1778, Major Benjamin Tallmadge formed the Culper Ring at Washington's direction to covertly collect information about the British in New York. [ 126 ] Intelligence from the Culper Ring saved French forces from a surprise British attack, which was itself based on intelligence from Washington's general turned British spy Benedict Arnold. [ 127 ] Washington had disregarded incidents of disloyalty by Arnold, who had distinguished himself in many campaigns, including the invasion of Quebec . [ 128 ] In 1779, Arnold began supplying the British spymaster John Andr\u00e9 with sensitive information intended to allow the British to capture West Point , a key American defensive position on the Hudson River. [ 129 ] On September 21, Arnold gave Andr\u00e9 plans to take over the garrison. [ 130 ] Andr\u00e9 was captured by militia who discovered the plans, after which Arnold escaped to New York. [ 131 ] On being told about Arnold's treason, Washington recalled the commanders positioned under Arnold at key points around the fort to prevent any complicity. He assumed personal command at West Point and reorganized its defenses. [ 132 ] Southern theater and Yorktown Main articles: Southern theater of the American Revolutionary War and Siege of Yorktown Map of the Siege of Yorktown By June 1780, the British had occupied the South Carolina Piedmont and had firm control of the South. Washington was reinvigorated, however, when Lafayette returned from France with more ships, men, and supplies, [ 133 ] and 5,000 veteran French troops led by Marshal Rochambeau arrived at Newport, Rhode Island in July. [ 134 ] General Clinton sent Arnold, now a British brigadier general, to Virginia in December with 1,700 troops to capture Portsmouth and conduct raids on Patriot forces. Washington sent Lafayette south to counter Arnold's efforts. [ 135 ] Washington initially hoped to bring the fight to New York, drawing the British forces away from Virginia and ending the war there, but Rochambeau advised him that Cornwallis in Virginia was the better target. [ 136 ] On August 19, 1781, Washington and Rochambeau began a march to Yorktown, Virginia , known now as the \" celebrated march \". [ 137 ] Washington was in command of an army of 7,800 Frenchmen, 3,100 militia, and 8,000 Continental troops. Inexperienced in siege warfare, he often deferred to the judgment of Rochambeau. Despite this, Rochambeau never challenged Washington's authority as the battle's commanding officer. [ 138 ] By late September, Patriot-French forces surrounded Yorktown, trapping the British Army, while the French navy emerged victorious at the Battle of the Chesapeake . The final American offensive began with a shot fired by Washington. [ 124 ] The siege ended with a British surrender on October 19, 1781; over 7,000 British soldiers became prisoners of war . [ 139 ] Washington negotiated the terms of surrender for two days, and the official signing ceremony took place on October 19. [ 140 ] Although the peace treaty was not negotiated for two more years, Yorktown proved to be the last significant battle of the Revolutionary War, with the British Parliament agreeing to cease hostilities in March 1782. [ 141 ] Demobilization and resignation Main article: George Washington's resignation as commander-in-chief General George Washington Resigning His Commission , an 1824 portrait by John Trumbull When peace negotiations began in April 1782, both the British and French began gradually evacuating their forces. [ 142 ] In March 1783, Washington successfully calmed the Newburgh Conspiracy , a planned mutiny by American officers dissatisfied with a lack of pay. [ 31 ] [ 143 ] Washington submitted an account of $450,000 in expenses which he had advanced to the army. The account was settled, though it was vague about large sums and included expenses his wife had incurred through visits to his headquarters. [ 144 ] When the Treaty of Paris was signed on September 3, 1783, Britain officially recognized American independence. Washington disbanded his army, giving a farewell address to his soldiers on November 2. [ 145 ] He oversaw the evacuation of British forces in New York and was greeted by parades and celebrations. [ 146 ] In early December 1783, Washington bade farewell to his officers at Fraunces Tavern and resigned as commander-in-chief soon after. [ 147 ] In a final appearance in uniform, he gave a statement to the Congress: \"I consider it an indispensable duty to close this last solemn act of my official life, by commending the interests of our dearest country to the protection of Almighty God, and those who have the superintendence of them, to his holy keeping.\" [ 148 ] Washington's resignation was acclaimed at home and abroad, \"extolled by later historians as a signal event that set the country's political course\" according to the historian Edward J. Larson . [ 149 ] [ i ] The same month, Washington was appointed president-general of the Society of the Cincinnati , a newly established hereditary fraternity of Revolutionary War officers. [ 151 ] Early republic (1783\u20131789) Further information: Confederation Period and Articles of Confederation Return to Mount Vernon \"I am not only retired from all public employments but I am retiring within myself, and shall be able to view the solitary walk and tread the paths of private life with heartfelt satisfaction\u00a0... I will move gently down the stream of life, until I sleep with my fathers.\" \u2014 George Washington in a letter to Lafayette. February 1, 1784. [ 152 ] After spending just ten days at Mount Vernon out of 8 + 1 \u2044 2 years of war, Washington was eager to return home. He arrived on Christmas Eve; Professor John E. Ferling wrote that he was delighted to be \"free of the bustle of a camp and the busy scenes of public life\". [ 153 ] He received a constant stream of visitors paying their respects at Mount Vernon. [ 154 ] Washington reactivated his interests in the Great Dismal Swamp and Potomac Canal projects, begun before the war, though neither paid him any dividends. [ 155 ] He undertook a 34-day, 680-mile (1,090\u00a0km) trip in 1784 to check on his land holdings in the Ohio Country. [ 156 ] He oversaw the completion of remodeling work at Mount Vernon, which transformed his residence into the mansion that survives to this day\u2014although his financial situation was not strong. Creditors paid him in depreciated wartime currency, and he owed significant amounts in taxes and wages. Mount Vernon had made no profit during his absence, and he saw persistently poor crop yields due to pestilence and bad weather. His estate recorded its eleventh year running at a deficit in 1787. [ 157 ] To make his estate profitable again, Washington undertook a new landscaping plan and succeeded in cultivating a range of fast-growing trees and native shrubs. [ 158 ] He also began breeding mules after being gifted a stud by King Charles III of Spain in 1785; [ 159 ] he believed that they would revolutionize agriculture. [ 160 ] Constitutional Convention of 1787 Main article: Constitutional Convention (United States) Scene at the Signing of the Constitution of the United States , a 1940 portrait by Howard Chandler Christy depicting Washington as the presiding officer at the Constitutional Convention in 1787 Before returning to private life in June 1783, Washington called for a strong union. Though he was concerned that he might be criticized for meddling in civil matters, he sent a circular letter to the states, maintaining that the Articles of Confederation were no more than \"a rope of sand\". He believed the nation was on the verge of \"anarchy and confusion\", was vulnerable to foreign intervention, and that a national constitution would unify the states under a strong central government. [ 161 ] When Shays' Rebellion erupted in Massachusetts in August 1786, Washington was further convinced that a national constitution was needed. [ 162 ] [ 31 ] Some nationalists feared that the new republic had descended into lawlessness, and they met on September 11, 1786, at Annapolis to ask the Congress to revise the Articles of Confederation. [ 163 ] Congress agreed to a Constitutional Convention to be held in Philadelphia in 1787, with each state to send delegates. [ 164 ] Washington was chosen to lead the Virginia delegation, but he declined. He had concerns about the legality of the convention and consulted James Madison , Henry Knox, and others. They persuaded him to attend as they felt his presence might induce reluctant states to send delegates and smooth the way for the ratification process while also giving legitimacy to the convention. [ 165 ] Washington arrived in Philadelphia on May 9, 1787, and the convention began on May 25. Benjamin Franklin nominated Washington to preside over the meeting, and he was unanimously elected. [ 166 ] The delegate Edmund Randolph introduced Madison's Virginia Plan ; it called for an entirely new constitution and a sovereign national government, which Washington highly recommended. [ 167 ] However, details around representation were particularly contentious, resulting in a competing New Jersey Plan being brought forward. [ 168 ] On July 10, Washington wrote to Alexander Hamilton: \"I almost despair of seeing a favorable issue to the proceedings of our convention and do therefore repent having had any agency in the business.\" [ 169 ] Nevertheless, he lent his prestige to the work of the other delegates, lobbying many to support the ratification of the Constitution . [ 170 ] The final version adopted the Connecticut Compromise between the two plans, and was signed by 39 of 55 delegates on September 17, 1787. [ 171 ] First presidential election Main article: 1788\u20131789 United States presidential election Just prior to the first presidential election of 1789, in 1788 Washington was appointed chancellor of the College of William & Mary . [ 172 ] He continued to serve through his presidency until his death. [ 173 ] The delegates to the convention for the first presidential election anticipated a Washington presidency and left it to him to define the office once elected. [ 169 ] When the state electors voted on February 4, 1789, [ 174 ] Washington was unanimously elected, unique among U.S. presidents. [ 175 ] John Adams was elected vice president. [ 176 ] Despite writing that he felt \"anxious and painful sensations\" about leaving Mount Vernon, Washington departed for New York City on April 16. [ 177 ] Presidency (1789\u20131797) Main article: Presidency of George Washington The Washington cabinet Office Name Term President George Washington 1789\u20131797 Vice President John Adams 1789\u20131797 Secretary of State John Jay (acting) 1789\u20131790 Thomas Jefferson 1790\u20131793 Edmund Randolph 1794\u20131795 Timothy Pickering 1795\u20131797 Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton 1789\u20131795 Oliver Wolcott Jr. 1795\u20131797 Secretary of War Henry Knox 1789\u20131794 Timothy Pickering 1795 James McHenry 1796\u20131797 Attorney General Edmund Randolph 1789\u20131794 William Bradford 1794\u20131795 Charles Lee 1795\u20131797 First term Further information: History of Washington, D.C. ; American School (economics) ; Whiskey Rebellion ; Northwest Indian War ; Treaty of New York (1790) ; and Cabinet of the United States Washington was inaugurated on April 30, 1789, taking the oath of office at Federal Hall in New York City. [ j ] [ 179 ] His coach was led by militia and a marching band and followed by statesmen and foreign dignitaries in an inaugural parade, with a crowd of 10,000. [ 180 ] Robert R. Livingston administered the oath, using a Bible provided by the Masons . [ 181 ] Washington read a speech in the Senate Chamber, asking \"that Almighty Being ... consecrate the liberties and happiness of the people of the United States\". [ 182 ] Though he wished to serve without a salary, Congress insisted that he receive one, [ 31 ] providing Washington $25,000 annually (compared to $5,000 annually for the vice president). [ 183 ] Washington wrote to James Madison: \"As the first of everything in our situation will serve to establish a precedent, it is devoutly wished on my part that these precedents be fixed on true principles.\" [ 184 ] To that end, he argued against the majestic titles proposed by the Senate, including \"His Majesty\" and \"His Highness the President\", in favor of \"Mr. President\". [ 185 ] His executive precedents included the inaugural address, messages to Congress, and the cabinet form of the executive branch . [ 186 ] He also selected the first justices for the Supreme Court . [ 187 ] Washington was an able administrator and judge of talent and character. [ 188 ] The old Confederation lacked the powers to handle its workload and had weak leadership, no executive, a small bureaucracy of clerks, large debt, worthless paper money, and no power to establish taxes. [ 189 ] Congress created executive departments in 1789, including the State Department , the War Department , and the Treasury Department . Washington appointed Edmund Randolph as Attorney General , Samuel Osgood as Postmaster General , Thomas Jefferson as Secretary of State , Henry Knox as Secretary of War , and Alexander Hamilton as Secretary of the Treasury . Washington's cabinet became a consulting and advisory body, not mandated by the Constitution. [ 190 ] Washington restricted cabinet discussions to topics of his choosing and expected department heads to agreeably carry out his decisions. [ 189 ] He exercised restraint in using his veto power , writing that \"I give my Signature to many Bills with which my Judgment is at variance.\" [ 191 ] Washington opposed political factionalism and remained non-partisan throughout his presidency (the only United States president to do so). He was sympathetic to a Federalist form of government. [ 192 ] Washington's closest advisors formed two factions, portending the First Party System . Hamilton formed the Federalist Party to promote national credit and a financially powerful nation. Jefferson opposed Hamilton's agenda and founded the Jeffersonian Republicans . Washington favored Hamilton's agenda, however, and it ultimately went into effect\u2014resulting in bitter controversy. [ 193 ] Other domestic issues during Washington's first term included the planning of a permanent capital, [ 194 ] the passage of several constitutional amendments including the Bill of Rights , and continuing debates concerning slavery [ 195 ] and expansion into Native American territory. [ 196 ] Washington proclaimed November 26, 1789, as a day of Thanksgiving to encourage national unity. [ 197 ] Second term Portrait of Thomas Jefferson Washington initially planned to retire after his first term, weary of office and in poor health. After dealing with the infighting in his cabinet and with partisan critics, he showed little enthusiasm for a second term, and Martha wanted him not to run. [ 198 ] Washington's nephew George Augustine Washington, managing Mount Vernon in his absence, was critically ill, further increasing Washington's desire to retire. [ 199 ] Many, however, urged him to run for a second term. Madison told him that his absence would allow the dangerous political rift in his cabinet and the House to worsen. Jefferson also pleaded with him not to retire, pledging to drop his attacks on Hamilton. [ 200 ] Hamilton maintained that Washington's absence would be \"deplored as the greatest evil\" to the country. [ 201 ] With the election of 1792 nearing, Washington agreed to run. [ 202 ] On February 13, 1793, the Electoral College unanimously re-elected Washington president, while John Adams was re-elected as vice president by a vote of 77 to 50. [ 202 ] Washington was sworn into office by Associate Justice William Cushing on March 4, 1793, in Congress Hall in Philadelphia. [ 203 ] On April 22, 1793, after the French Revolutionary Wars broke out, Washington issued a proclamation declaring American neutrality. He was resolved to pursue \"a conduct friendly and impartial toward the belligerent Powers\" while warning Americans not to intervene in the conflict. [ 204 ] Although Washington recognized France's revolutionary government, he eventually asked that the French minister to the United States, Edmond-Charles Gen\u00eat , be recalled. [ 205 ] Gen\u00eat was a diplomatic troublemaker who was openly hostile toward Washington's neutrality policy. He procured four American ships as privateers to strike at Spanish forces (British allies) in Florida while organizing militias to strike at other British possessions. However, his efforts failed to draw the United States into the conflict. [ 206 ] During his second term Washington faced two major domestic conflicts. The first was the Whiskey Rebellion (1791\u20131794), a Pennsylvania revolt against liquor taxation. Washington mobilized a militia and personally commanded an expedition against the rebels which suppressed the insurgency. [ 207 ] [ 31 ] The second was the Northwest Indian War between White settlers and Native Americans who were supported by the British; the latter were stationed in forts that they had refused to abandon after the Revolutionary War. [ 31 ] [ 208 ] In 1794 American troops defeated the Native American forces at the Battle of Fallen Timbers , ending the conflict between the two. [ 31 ] Hamilton formulated the Jay Treaty to normalize trade relations with Britain while removing them from western forts, and also to resolve financial debts remaining from the Revolution. [ 209 ] Chief Justice John Jay represented Washington's position and signed the treaty on November 19, 1794. Washington supported the treaty because it avoided war, [ 210 ] although he was disappointed that its provisions favored Britain. [ 211 ] He mobilized public opinion and secured ratification [ 212 ] but faced frequent public criticism and political controversy. [ 213 ] [ 31 ] Following the British abandonment of their forts around the Great Lakes , the proposed position of the Canada\u2013United States border was sent to arbitration . Numerous pre-Revolution debts were settled and the British opened the British West Indies to American merchants. The agreement secured peace with Britain and a decade of prosperous trade; however, Jefferson claimed that it angered France and \"invited rather than avoided\" war. [ 214 ] Jefferson's claim was verified when relations with France deteriorated after the signing of the treaty, with the French Directory authorizing the seizure of American ships two days before Washington's term ended. [ 215 ] Succeeding president John Adams was left with the prospect of war. [ 216 ] Relations with the Spanish were more successful: Thomas Pinckney negotiated the Treaty of San Lorenzo in 1795, settling the border between the United States and Spanish territory, and guaranteeing American navigational access to the Mississippi River [ 31 ] [ 217 ] On July 31, 1793, Jefferson submitted his resignation from cabinet. [ 218 ] Hamilton resigned from office in January 1795 and was replaced by Oliver Wolcott Jr. Washington's relationship with Secretary of War Henry Knox deteriorated over rumors that Knox had profited from contracts for the construction of U.S. frigates ostensibly commissioned to combat Barbary pirates under the Naval Act of 1794 . Knox was forced to resign. [ 219 ] [ 220 ] In the final months of his presidency, Washington was assailed by his political foes and a partisan press who accused him of being ambitious and greedy. He came to regard the press as a disuniting force. [ 221 ] Washington also opposed demands by Congress to see papers related to the Jay Treaty, arguing that they were not \"relative to any purpose under the cognizance of the House of Representatives, except that of an impeachment, which the resolution has not expressed.\" [ 31 ] Farewell Address Main article: George Washington's Farewell Address Washington's Farewell Address , published by the American Daily Advertiser on September 19, 1796 At the end of his second term, Washington retired. He was dismayed with the personal attacks against him and wanted to ensure that a truly contested presidential election could be held. He did not feel bound to a two-term limit, but his retirement set a significant precedent. [ 222 ] In May 1792, in anticipation of his retirement, Washington instructed James Madison to prepare a \" valedictory address \", an initial draft of which was entitled the \"Farewell Address\". [ 223 ] In May 1796, Washington sent the manuscript to Hamilton, who did an extensive rewrite, while Washington provided final edits. [ 224 ] On September 19, 1796, David Claypoole's American Daily Advertiser published the address. [ 225 ] Washington stressed that national identity was paramount, and said that the \"name of AMERICAN... must always exalt the just pride of patriotism\". [ 226 ] Washington warned against the dangers of political parties and entangling foreign alliances with domestic affairs. [ 227 ] He counseled friendship and commerce with all nations, but advised against involvement in European wars. [ 228 ] He stressed the importance of religion, asserting that \"religion and morality are indispensable supports\" in a republic. [ 229 ] He closed the address by reflecting on his legacy: \"I fervently beseech the Almighty to avert or mitigate the evils to which [my unintentioned errors] may tend. I shall also carry with me the hope that my country will never cease to view them with indulgence, and that, after forty-five years of my life dedicated to its service with an upright zeal, the faults of incompetent abilities will be consigned to oblivion, as myself must soon be to the mansions of rest .\" [ 230 ] After initial publication, many Republicans, including Madison, criticized the address and described it as an anti-French campaign document, with Madison believing that Washington was strongly pro-British. [ 231 ] In 1972, the Washington scholar James Flexner referred to the Farewell Address as receiving as much acclaim as Thomas Jefferson's Declaration of Independence and Abraham Lincoln 's Gettysburg Address . [ 232 ] In 2010, Chernow called the \"Farewell Address\" one of the most influential statements on republicanism . [ 233 ] Post-presidency (1797\u20131799) Further information: Post-presidency of George Washington Retirement The Lansdowne portrait (1796) See also: Finances of George Washington Washington retired to Mount Vernon in March 1797 and devoted time to his business interests. [ 234 ] His plantation operations were minimally profitable, [ 33 ] and his lands in the west (on the Piedmont ) yielded little income; he attempted to sell these but was unable to. [ 235 ] He became an even more committed Federalist. He vocally supported the Alien and Sedition Acts and convinced Federalist John Marshall to run for Congress to weaken the Jeffersonian hold on Virginia . [ 236 ] French privateers began seizing American ships in 1798, and deteriorating relations led to the \" Quasi-War \". Washington wrote to Secretary of War James McHenry offering to organize President Adams' army. [ 237 ] Adams nominated him for a lieutenant general commission and the position of commander-in-chief of the armies on July 4, 1798. [ 238 ] Washington served as the commanding general from July 13, 1798, until his death 17 months later. [ 239 ] He participated in planning but delegated the active leadership of the army to Hamilton. No army invaded the United States during this period, and Washington did not assume a field command. [ 240 ] Washington was known to be rich because of what Chernow calls the \"glorified fa\u00e7ade of wealth and grandeur\" at Mount Vernon. [ 241 ] However, nearly all of his wealth was in the form of land and slaves rather than ready cash. To supplement his income, he erected a distillery for whiskey production. [ 242 ] He bought land parcels to spur development around the new Federal City (named in his honor in 1791), and he sold individual lots to middle-income investors rather than multiple lots to large investors, believing the former would be more likely to commit to making improvements. [ 243 ] At the time of his death in 1799, his estate was worth an estimated $780,000, [ 244 ] and he held title to more than 58,000 acres (23,000\u00a0ha) of land across Virginia, Ohio, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New York, Kentucky , and the Northwest Territory . [ 244 ] Washington's peak net worth was estimated to be $587\u00a0million in 2020 dollars. [ 245 ] Death Washington on his Deathbed , an 1851 portrait by Junius Brutus Stearns On December 12, 1799, Washington inspected his farms on horseback in inclement weather for five hours. He then dined with guests without putting on dry clothes. [ 246 ] He had a sore throat the next day but was well enough to mark trees for cutting. [ 247 ] Early the following morning, he awoke to an inflamed throat and difficulty breathing. He ordered his estate overseer, George Rawlins, to remove nearly a pint of his blood ( bloodletting was a common practice of the time). His family summoned doctors James Craik , Gustavus Richard Brown , and Elisha C. Dick . [ 248 ] Brown initially believed Washington had quinsy ; Dick thought the condition was a more serious \"violent inflammation of the membranes of the throat\". [ 249 ] They continued bloodletting to approximately five pints, but Washington's condition deteriorated further. Dick proposed a tracheotomy ; the other physicians were not familiar with that procedure and disapproved. [ 250 ] Washington instructed Brown and Dick to leave the room, while he assured Craik, \"Doctor, I die hard, but I am not afraid to go.\" [ 251 ] On his deathbed, afraid of being entombed alive, Washington instructed his private secretary Tobias Lear to wait three days before his burial. [ 252 ] According to Lear, Washington died between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m. on December 14, 1799, with Martha seated at the foot of his bed. His last words were \" 'Tis well.\" [ 253 ] The diagnosis of Washington's illness and the immediate cause of his death have been subjects of debate. The published account of Craik and Brown stated that his symptoms were consistent with \"cynanche trachealis\", a term then used to describe severe inflammation of the upper windpipe, including quinsy. [ k ] Accusations of medical malpractice have persisted since Washington's death. [ 250 ] Modern medical authors have largely concluded that he likely died from severe epiglottitis complicated by the treatments he was given, which included multiple doses of calomel (a purgative) and extensive bloodletting, likely resulting in hypovolemic shock . [ l ] Funeral and burial Washington's funeral was held on December 18, 1799, four days after his death, at Mount Vernon. Cavalry and foot soldiers led the procession, and six colonels served as the pallbearers. The Mount Vernon funeral service was restricted mostly to family and friends. [ 258 ] Reverend Thomas Davis read a brief funeral service, followed by a ceremony performed by members of Washington's Masonic lodge; Washington had been a Freemason since 1752. [ 259 ] [ 260 ] Word of his death traveled slowly, but as it reached other regions, church bells rang and many businesses closed. [ 261 ] Memorial processions were held in major cities of the United States. Martha burned her correspondence with Washington to protect its privacy, though five letters between the couple are known to have survived. [ 262 ] The sarcophagi of George (right) and Martha Washington at the entrance to their tomb in Mount Vernon Washington was buried in the Washington family vault at Mount Vernon on December 18, 1799. [ 263 ] In his will, Washington left instructions for the construction of a new vault; [ 261 ] this was completed in 1831, after a disgruntled ex-employee of the estate attempted to steal what he thought was Washington's skull. [ 264 ] In 1832, a joint Congressional committee debated moving his body from Mount Vernon to a crypt in the United States Capitol . Southern opposition was intense, antagonized by an ever-growing rift between North and South; many were concerned that Washington's remains could end up, in the words of Representative Wiley Thompson , on \"a shore foreign to his native soil\" if the country became divided, and Washington's remains stayed in Mount Vernon. [ 265 ] On October 7, 1837, Washington's remains, still in the original lead coffin, were placed within a marble sarcophagus designed by William Strickland and constructed by John Struthers. [ 266 ] Philosophy and views Slavery Main article: George Washington and slavery Further information: Slavery in the colonial United States , Slavery in the United States , and Abolitionism in the United States Washington the Farmer at Mount Vernon , an 1851 portrait by Junius Brutus Stearns During Washington's lifetime at least 577 slaves lived and worked at Mount Vernon. [ 267 ] [ 268 ] He inherited some, gained control of 84 dower slaves upon his marriage to Martha, and purchased at least 71 slaves between 1752 and 1773. [ 269 ] From 1786, he rented slaves as part of an agreement regarding a neighboring estate; they totaled 40 in 1799. [ 270 ] Slavery was deeply ingrained in the economic and social fabric of the Colony of Virginia . [ 271 ] [ 272 ] Prior to the Revolutionary War, Washington's views on slavery matched those of most Virginia planters of the time: \"his principal interest was still their contribution to the economic life of the plantation.\" [ 273 ] Beginning in the 1760s, however, Washington gradually grew to oppose it. His first doubts were prompted by his choice to transition from tobacco to grain crops, which left him with a costly surplus of slaves, causing him to question the system's economic efficiency. [ 274 ] In a 1778 letter to Lund Washington , he made clear his desire \"to get quit of Negroes\". [ 275 ] His growing disillusionment with the institution was spurred by the principles of the Revolution and revolutionary friends such as Lafayette and Hamilton. [ 276 ] Most historians agree the Revolution was central to the evolution of Washington's attitudes; [ 277 ] Kenneth Morgan writes that after 1783, \"[Washington] began to express inner tensions about the problem of slavery more frequently, though always in private\". [ 278 ] As president, he remained publicly silent on the topic, believing it was a nationally divisive issue that could undermine the union. [ 279 ] He gave moral support to a plan proposed by Lafayette to purchase land and free slaves to work on it, but chose not to participate in the experiment. [ 280 ] Washington privately expressed support for emancipation to prominent Methodists Thomas Coke and Francis Asbury in 1785 but declined to sign their petition. [ 281 ] In personal correspondence the next year, he made clear his desire to see the institution of slavery ended by a gradual legislative process, a view that correlated with the mainstream antislavery literature published in the 1780s. [ 282 ] Washington emancipated 123 or 124 slaves, which was highly unusual among the large slave-holding Virginians during the Revolutionary era. [ 283 ] However, he remained dependent on slave labor to work his farms. [ 284 ] Runaway advertisement for Ona Judge , enslaved servant in Washington's presidential household Based on his private papers and on accounts from his contemporaries, Washington slowly developed a cautious sympathy toward abolitionism that ended with his will freeing his long-time valet Billy Lee , and freeing the rest of his personally owned slaves outright upon Martha's death. [ 285 ] On January 1, 1801, one year after George Washington's death, Martha Washington signed an order to free his slaves. Many of them were reluctant to leave; others refused to abandon spouses or children still held as dower slaves by the Custis estate. [ 286 ] Following Washington's instructions in his will, funds were used to feed and clothe the young, aged, and infirm slaves until the early 1830s. [ 287 ] [ 31 ] Religious and spiritual views Main article: Religious views of George Washington Washington as a Freemason Washington was baptized as an infant in April 1732 and was a devoted member of the Anglican Church . [ 288 ] He served for more than 20 years as a vestryman and churchwarden at the Fairfax and Truro parishes in Virginia. [ 289 ] He privately prayed and read the Bible daily, and publicly encouraged prayer. [ 290 ] He may have taken communion regularly prior to the Revolution, but he did not do so afterwards. [ 291 ] Washington referred to God in American Enlightenment terms, including Providence , the Almighty , and the Divine Author . [ 292 ] He believed in a divine power who watched over battlefields, influenced the outcome of war, protected his life, and was involved in American politics and specifically in the creation of the United States. [ 293 ] Chernow has argued that Washington avoided evangelistic Christianity, hellfire-and-brimstone speech, and anything inclined to \"flaunt his religiosity\", saying that he \"never used his religion as a device for partisan purposes or in official undertakings\". [ 294 ] At the same time, Washington frequently quoted from or paraphrased the Bible, and often referred to the Anglican Book of Common Prayer . [ 295 ] While president, Washington acknowledged major religious sects, gave speeches on religious toleration, and opposed state religion . [ 296 ] He adopted the ideas, values, and modes of thinking of the Enlightenment, [ 297 ] but he harbored no contempt for organized Christianity and its clergy. [ 297 ] In 1793, speaking to members of the New Church in Baltimore , Washington said, \"We have abundant reason to rejoice that in this Land the light of truth and reason has triumphed over the power of bigotry and superstition.\" [ 298 ] Freemasonry was a widely accepted institution in the late 18th century, known for advocating moral teachings. [ 299 ] American Masonic lodges did not share the anti-clerical views of the controversial European lodges . [ 300 ] A Masonic lodge was established in Fredericksburg, Virginia , in September 1752, and Washington was initiated two months later at the age of 20 as one of its first Entered Apprentices. Within a year, he progressed through its ranks to become a Master Mason. [ 259 ] In 1777, he was recommended for the office of Grand Master of the newly established Grand Lodge of Virginia ; sources differ as to whether he declined or was never asked, but he did not assume the role. [ 301 ] He served as the charter Master of Alexandria Masonic lodge No. 22 in 1788\u20131789. [ 302 ] Personal life Washington's 1751 bout with smallpox may have rendered him sterile, though Chernow notes that it is possible Martha \"sustained injury during the birth of Patsy, her final child, making additional births impossible\". [ 303 ] The couple lamented not having any children together. [ 304 ] The two raised Martha's children John Parke Custis (Jacky) and Martha Parke Custis (Patsy), and later Jacky's two youngest children Eleanor Parke Custis (Nelly) and George Washington Parke Custis (Washy), and supported numerous nieces and nephews. [ 305 ] Some descendants of West Ford , a slave of Washington's younger brother John Augustine Washington , maintain (based on family oral history ) that Ford was fathered by George Washington, though this paternity has been disputed. [ 306 ] Washington was somewhat reserved in personality, although he was known for having a strong presence. He made speeches and announcements when required, but he was not a noted orator nor debater. [ 307 ] He drank alcohol in moderation but was morally opposed to excessive drinking, smoking tobacco, gambling, and profanity. [ 308 ] He was taller than most of his contemporaries; [ 309 ] accounts of his height vary from 6\u00a0ft (1.83\u00a0m) to 6\u00a0ft 3.5\u00a0in (1.92\u00a0m). [ 310 ] He was known for his strength. [ 311 ] He had grey-blue eyes and long reddish-brown hair. [ 312 ] He did not wear a powdered wig ; instead he wore his hair curled, powdered, and tied in a queue in the fashion of the day . [ 313 ] [ 314 ] Washington suffered from severe tooth decay and ultimately lost all of his teeth except one. He had several sets of false teeth during his presidency. Contrary to common lore, these were not made of wood, but of metal, ivory , bone, animal teeth, and human teeth possibly obtained from slaves. [ 315 ] [ 316 ] His dental problems left him in constant pain, which he treated with laudanum . [ 317 ] He also experienced a painful growth in his thigh early in his first presidential term, followed by a life-threatening bout of pneumonia in 1790 from which he never fully recovered. [ 318 ] Washington was a talented equestrian. Jefferson described him as \"the best horseman of his age\". [ 319 ] He collected thoroughbreds at Mount Vernon; his two favorite horses were Blueskin and Nelson . [ 320 ] Legacy Further information: Legacy of George Washington and Historical rankings of presidents of the United States See also: Cultural depictions of George Washington Mount Rushmore National Memorial Washington is one of the most influential figures in American history. [ 321 ] Virginia's Governor Henry Lee eulogized him as \"first in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen\". [ 31 ] Polls have consistently placed Washington among the highest-ranked of presidents. [ 322 ] [ 323 ] [ 324 ] Washington became an international symbol for liberation and nationalism as the leader of the first successful revolution against a colonial empire. [ 325 ] In 1879, Congress proclaimed Washington's Birthday to be a federal holiday. [ 326 ] In 1976, he was posthumously appointed General of the Armies of the United States during the American Bicentennial . President Gerald Ford stated that Washington would \"rank first among all officers of the Army, past and present\". [ m ] [ 328 ] On March 13, 1978, Washington was officially promoted by the Army. [ 329 ] In 1809, Mason Locke Weems wrote a hagiographic biography to honor Washington. [ 330 ] Chernow maintains that Weems attempted to humanize Washington, inspire \"patriotism and morality\", and foster \"enduring myths\", such as that of Washington's refusal to lie about damaging his father's cherry tree . [ 331 ] [ 332 ] Weems' accounts have never been proven or disproven. [ 333 ] In the 21st century, Washington's reputation has been critically scrutinized. The historian John Ferling maintains that Washington remains the only founder and president ever to be referred to as \"godlike\", and points out that his character has been the most scrutinized by historians. [ 334 ] The author David Hackett Fischer defined Washington's character as \"integrity, self-discipline, courage, absolute honesty, resolve, and decision, but also forbearance, decency, and respect for others\". [ 335 ] Chernow describes Washington as always trying to be even-handed in dealing with Indigenous peoples, hoping they would abandon their itinerant hunting life and adapt to fixed agricultural communities in the manner of White settlers. He also maintains that Washington never advocated outright confiscation of tribal land or the forcible removal of tribes. [ 336 ] By contrast, Colin G. Calloway wrote that \"Washington had a lifelong obsession with getting Indian land, either for himself or for his nation, and initiated policies and campaigns that had devastating effects in Indian country.\" [ 337 ] He stated: The growth of the nation demanded the dispossession of Indian people. Washington hoped the process could be bloodless and that Indian people would give up their lands for a \"fair\" price and move away. But if Indians refused and resisted, as they often did, he felt he had no choice but to \"extirpate\" them and that the expeditions he sent to destroy Indian towns were therefore entirely justified. [ 338 ] Along with other Founding Fathers, Washington has been criticized for holding enslaved people. Though he expressed the desire to see the abolition of slavery through legislation, he did not initiate or support any initiatives for bringing about its end. This has led to calls to remove his name from public buildings and his statue from public spaces. [ 339 ] [ 340 ] Washington's presidential library is housed at Mount Vernon, [ 341 ] which is now a National Historic Landmark . [ 342 ] His papers are held by the Library of Congress . [ 343 ] Namesakes and monuments Further information: List of memorials to George Washington and List of statues of George Washington The Washington Monument Many places and monuments have been named in honor of Washington, including the capital city of Washington, D.C. , and the state of Washington . [ 344 ] On February 21, 1885, the Washington Monument was dedicated, a 555-foot (169\u00a0m) marble obelisk on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. [ 345 ] [ 346 ] Washington appears as one of four presidents on the Shrine of Democracy , a colossal sculpture by Gutzon Borglum on Mount Rushmore in South Dakota . [ 347 ] [ 346 ] The George Washington Bridge , opened in 1931, connects New York City to New Jersey . [ 348 ] A number of secondary schools and universities are named in honor of Washington, including George Washington University and Washington University in St. Louis . [ 349 ] [ 350 ] He appears on contemporary United States currency, including the one-dollar bill , the Presidential one-dollar coin and the quarter-dollar coin (the Washington quarter ). [ 351 ] [ 352 ] Washington was pictured on the nation's first postage stamp in 1847, and has since appeared on more United States postage stamps than anyone else.

The British Calendar (New Style) Act 1750 implemented in 1752 altered the official British dating method to the Gregorian calendar with the start of the year on January 1 (it had been March 25). These changes resulted in dates being moved forward 11 days and an advance of one year for those between January 1 and March 25. For a further explanation, see Old Style and New Style dates . [ 2 ] ^ The college's charter gave it the authority to appoint Virginia county surveyors. There is no evidence that Washington actually attended classes there. [ 12 ] ^ The word \"Indian\" was used at the time to describe the Indigenous peoples of the Americas . [ 25 ] ^ He had been defeated in his campaigns for the seat in 1755 and 1757. [ 52 ] ^ In a letter of September 20, 1765, Washington protested to \"Robert Cary & Co.\" regarding the low prices he received for his tobacco and the inflated prices he was forced to pay on second-rate goods from London. [ 55 ] ^ Other reasons Washington was perceived as the best choice for the commander role, according to Chernow, included his \"superior presence, infinitely better judgment, more political cunning, and unmatched gravitas... he had the perfect temperament for leadership.\" [ 69 ] ^ On January 24, 1776, Congressional delegate Edward Rutledge , echoing General George Washington's own concerns, suggested that a war office similar to Great Britain's be established. [ 86 ] Organization of the Board of War underwent several significant changes after its inception in 1776. [ 87 ] ^ See, for example, Todd W. Braisted, Grand Forage 1778 , Westholme Publishing, 2016. ^ Thomas Jefferson praised Washington for his \"moderation and virtue\" in relinquishing command. Reportedly, upon being informed of Washington's plans by painter Benjamin West , King George III remarked: \"If he does that, he will be the greatest man in the world.\" [ 150 ] ^ There has been debate over whether Washington added \"so help me God\" to the end of the oath. [ 178 ] ^ The first account of Washington's death was written by doctors Craik and Brown, published in The Times of Alexandria five days after his death. The complete text can be found in The Eclectic Medical Journal (1858).

[ 257 ] ^ In Portraits & Biographical Sketches of the United States Army's Senior Officer , William Gardner Bell states that Washington was recalled to military service from his retirement in 1798, and \"Congress passed legislation that would have made him General of the Armies of the United States, but his services were not required in the field, and the appointment was not made until the Bicentennial in 1976 when it was bestowed posthumously as a commemorative honor.\" [ 327 ] References ^ Randall 1997 , p.\u00a0303. ^ \"The history of the calendar\" .

George Washington is often called the \u201cFather of His Country.\u201d He not only served as the first president of the United States , but he also commanded the Continental Army during the American Revolution (1775\u201383) and presided over the convention that drafted the U.S. Constitution . The U.S. capital is named after Washington\u2014as are many schools, parks, and cities. Today his face appears on the U.S. dollar bill and the quarter. What political party did George Washington belong to? George Washington did not belong to a political party. He ran as a nonpartisan candidate in the presidential elections of 1789 and 1792 . To this day, Washington is the only U.S. president to have been unanimously elected by the electoral college . Did George Washington own slaves? Yes, George Washington owned slaves. Washington was born into a Virginia planter family. After his father\u2019s death in 1743, Washington inherited 10 enslaved people. In 1761 Washington acquired a farmhouse (which he later expanded to a five-farm estate) called Mount Vernon . In 1760, 49 enslaved people lived and worked on the estate; by 1799 that number had increased to over 300. Washington eventually freed the 123 people he owned. In his will he ordered that they be freed \u201cupon the decease of my wife .\u201d How did George Washington die? After serving two terms as president, George Washington retired to his estate at Mount Vernon in 1797. Two years into his retirement, Washington caught a cold. The cold developed into a throat infection. Doctors cared for Washington as they thought best\u2014by bleeding him, blistering him, and attempting (unsuccessfully) to give him a gargle of \u201cmolasses, vinegar, and butter.\u201d Despite their efforts, Washington died on the night of December 14, 1799. Did George Washington chop down his father\u2019s cherry tree? For years people have shared a story about the first U.S. president involving a hatchet, a cherry tree, and a young Washington who \u201ccannot tell a lie.\u201d The legend attests to George Washington\u2019s honesty, virtue, and piety\u2014that is, if it is true. It is not. The legend was the invention of a 19th-century bookseller named Mason Locke Weems who wanted to present a role model to his American readers. It is one of many legends about Washington.

(more) See all videos for this article George Washington (born February 22 [February 11, Old Style], 1732, Westmoreland county, Virginia [U.S.]\u2014died December 14, 1799, Mount Vernon, Virginia, U.S.) was an American general and commander in chief of the colonial armies in the American Revolution (1775\u201383) and subsequently first president of the United States (1789\u201397). Washington\u2019s father, Augustine Washington, had gone to school in England, tasted seafaring life, and then settled down to manage his growing Virginia estates. His mother was Mary Ball, whom Augustine, a widower, had married early the previous year. Washington\u2019s paternal lineage had some distinction; an early forebear was described as a \u201cgentleman,\u201d Henry VIII later gave the family lands, and its members held various offices. But family fortunes fell with the Puritan revolution in England, and John Washington, grandfather of Augustine, migrated in 1657 to Virginia. The ancestral home at Sulgrave, Northamptonshire , is maintained as a Washington memorial. Little definite information exists on any of the line until Augustine. He was an energetic, ambitious man who acquired much land, built mills, took an interest in opening iron mines, and sent his two eldest sons to England for schooling. By his first wife, Jane Butler, he had four children. By his second wife, Mary Ball, he had six. Augustine died April 12, 1743.

(more) 2 of 2 George Washington: map Map of a portion of the Ohio River region made by George Washington, 1754. (more) Little is known of George Washington\u2019s early childhood, spent largely on the Ferry Farm on the Rappahannock River , opposite Fredericksburg , Virginia. Mason L. Weems \u2019s stories of the hatchet and cherry tree and of young Washington\u2019s repugnance to fighting are apocryphal efforts to fill a manifest gap. He attended school irregularly from his 7th to his 15th year, first with the local church sexton and later with a schoolmaster named Williams. Some of his schoolboy papers survive. He was fairly well trained in practical mathematics\u2014gauging, several types of mensuration, and such trigonometry as was useful in surveying . He studied geography, possibly had a little Latin, and certainly read some of The Spectator and other English classics. The copybook in which he transcribed at 14 a set of moral precepts, or Rules of Civility and Decent Behaviour in Company and Conversation , was carefully preserved. His best training, however, was given him by practical men and outdoor occupations, not by books. He mastered tobacco growing and stock raising, and early in his teens he was sufficiently familiar with surveying to plot the fields about him. At his father\u2019s death, the 11-year-old boy became the ward of his half brother Lawrence, a man of fine character who gave him wise and affectionate care. Lawrence inherited the beautiful estate of Little Hunting Creek, which had been granted to the original settler, John Washington, and which Augustine had done much since 1738 to develop. Lawrence married Anne (Nancy) Fairfax, daughter of Col. William Fairfax, a cousin and agent of Lord Fairfax and one of the chief proprietors of the region. Lawrence also built a house and named the 2,500-acre (1,000-hectare) holding Mount Vernon in honor of the admiral under whom he had served in the siege of Cartagena . Living there chiefly with Lawrence (though he spent some time near Fredericksburg with his other half brother, Augustine, called Austin), George entered a more spacious and polite world. Anne Fairfax Washington was a woman of charm, grace, and culture; Lawrence had brought from his English school and naval service much knowledge and experience. A valued neighbor and relative, George William Fairfax, whose large estate, Belvoir, was about 4 miles (6 km) distant, and other relatives by marriage, the Carlyles of Alexandria, helped form George\u2019s mind and manners. The youth turned first to surveying as a profession. Lord Fairfax, a middle-aged bachelor who owned more than 5,000,000 acres (2,000,000 hectares) in northern Virginia and the Shenandoah Valley , came to America in 1746 to live with his cousin George William at Belvoir and to look after his properties. Two years later he sent to the Shenandoah Valley a party to survey and plot his lands to make regular tenants of the squatters moving in from Pennsylvania . With the official surveyor of Prince William county in charge, Washington went along as assistant. The 16-year-old lad kept a disjointed diary of the trip, which shows skill in observation. He describes the discomfort of sleeping under \u201cone thread Bear blanket with double its Weight of Vermin such as Lice Fleas & c\u201d; an encounter with an Indian war party bearing a scalp; the Pennsylvania-German emigrants, \u201cas ignorant a set of people as the Indians they would never speak English but when spoken to they speak all Dutch\u201d; and the serving of roast wild turkey on \u201ca Large Chip,\u201d for \u201cas for dishes we had none.\u201d Britannica Quiz Facts You Should Know: American Revolution The following year (1749), aided by Lord Fairfax, Washington received an appointment as official surveyor of Culpeper county, and for more than two years he was kept almost constantly busy. Surveying not only in Culpeper but also in Frederick and Augusta counties, he made journeys far beyond the Tidewater region into the western wilderness. The experience taught him resourcefulness and endurance and toughened him in both body and mind. Coupled with Lawrence\u2019s ventures in land, it also gave him an interest in western development that endured throughout his life. He was always disposed to speculate in western holdings and to view favorably projects for colonizing the West, and he greatly resented the limitations that the crown in time laid on the westward movement . In 1752 Lord Fairfax determined to take up his final residence in the Shenandoah Valley and settled there in a log hunting lodge, which he called Greenway Court after a Kentish manor of his family\u2019s. There Washington was sometimes entertained and had access to a small library that Fairfax had begun accumulating at Oxford. Mount Vernon East view of the mansion at Mount Vernon, Fairfax county, Virginia. (more) The years 1751\u201352 marked a turning point in Washington\u2019s life, for they placed him in control of Mount Vernon . Lawrence, stricken by tuberculosis , went to Barbados in 1751 for his health, taking George along. From this sole journey beyond the present borders of the United States, Washington returned with the light scars of an attack of smallpox . In July of the next year, Lawrence died, making George executor and residuary heir of his estate should his daughter, Sarah, die without issue. As she died within two months, Washington at age 20 became head of one of the best Virginia estates. He always thought farming the \u201cmost delectable\u201d of pursuits. \u201cIt is honorable,\u201d he wrote, \u201cit is amusing, and, with superior judgment, it is profitable.\u201d And, of all the spots for farming, he thought Mount Vernon the best. \u201cNo estate in United America,\u201d he assured an English correspondent, \u201cis more pleasantly situated than this.\u201d His greatest pride in later days was to be regarded as the first farmer of the land.

He enlarged the house in 1760 and made further enlargements and improvements on the house and its landscaping in 1784\u201386. He also tried to keep abreast of the latest scientific advances. The Farmer , George Washington The Farmer , lithograph, 1853, portrays George Washington, offering a sentimentalized view of slaves working at Mount Vernon. (more) For the next 20 years the main background of Washington\u2019s life was the work and society of Mount Vernon. He gave assiduous attention to the rotation of crops, fertilization of the soil, and the management of livestock. He had to manage the 18 slaves that came with the estate and others he bought later; by 1760 he had paid taxes on 49 slaves\u2014though he strongly disapproved of the institution and hoped for some mode of abolishing it. At the time of his death, more than 300 slaves were housed in the quarters on his property. He had been unwilling to sell slaves lest families be broken up, even though the increase in their numbers placed a burden on him for their upkeep and gave him a larger force of workers than he required, especially after he gave up the cultivation of tobacco. In his will, he bequeathed the slaves in his possession to his wife and ordered that upon her death they be set free, declaring also that the young, the aged, and the infirm among them \u201cshall be comfortably cloathed & fed by my heirs.\u201d Still, this accounted for only about half the slaves on his property. The other half, owned by his wife, were entailed to the Custis estate, so that on her death they were destined to pass to her heirs. However, she freed all the slaves in 1800 after his death. For diversion Washington was fond of riding, fox hunting, and dancing, of such theatrical performances as he could reach, and of duck hunting and sturgeon fishing. He liked billiards and cards and not only subscribed to racing associations but also ran his own horses in races. In all outdoor pursuits, from wrestling to colt breaking, he excelled. A friend of the 1750s describes him as \u201cstraight as an Indian, measuring six feet two inches in his stockings\u201d; as very muscular and broad-shouldered but, though large-boned, weighing only 175 pounds; and as having long arms and legs. His penetrating blue-gray eyes were overhung by heavy brows, his nose was large and straight, and his mouth was large and firmly closed. \u201cHis movements and gestures are graceful, his walk majestic, and he is a splendid horseman.\u201d He soon became prominent in community affairs, was an active member and later vestryman of the Episcopal church , and as early as 1755 expressed a desire to stand for the Virginia House of Burgesses ."

Through these roles, Washington exemplified character and leadership. Jump Lower Select a link Birth & Childhood Slavery Surveying The French & Indian War House of Burgesses Marriage & Family Entrepreneur Revolutionary War Constitutional Convention President of the United States Retirement & Death Childhood and Education George Washington was born at his family's plantation on Popes Creek in Westmoreland County, Virginia, on February 22, 1732, to Augustine and Mary Ball Washington . George's father was a leading planter in the area and served as a justice of the county court. Augustine Washington's first wife, Jane\u00a0Butler, died in 1729, leaving him with two sons, Lawrence and Augustine, Jr., and a daughter, Jane. George was the eldest of Augustine and Mary's six children: George, Elizabeth , Samuel, John Augustine, Charles , and Mildred. Ferry Farm Around 1734, the family moved up the Potomac River to another Washington property, Little Hunting Creek Plantation (later renamed Mount Vernon). In 1738, they moved again to Ferry Farm , a plantation on the Rappahannock River near Fredericksburg, Virginia, where George spent much of his youth. Little is known of George Washington's childhood, and it remains the most poorly understood part of his life. When he was eleven years old, his father Augustine died, leaving most of his property to George's adult half brothers. The income from what remained was just sufficient to maintain Mary Washington and her children. As the oldest of Mary's children, George undoubtedly helped his mother manage the Rappahannock River plantation where they lived. There he learned the importance of hard work and efficiency. Washington's Education Unlike many of his contemporaries, Washington never attended college or received a formal education. His two older half brothers, Lawrence and Augustine, attended Appleby Grammar School in England. However, after the death of their father, the family limited funds for education. Private tutors and possibly a local school in Fredericksburg provided George and his siblings with the only formal instruction he would receive. In addition to reading, writing, and basic legal forms, George studied geometry and trigonometry\u2014in preparation for his first career as a surveyor\u2014and manners\u2014which would shape his character and conduct for the rest of his life.

Lawrence Washington (Mount Vernon Ladies' Association) The Rules of Civility and Decent Behaviour Before the age of sixteen, George Washington copied out the 110 rules covered in The Rules of Civility and Decent Behaviour. This exercise, now regarded as a formative influence in the development of his character, included guidelines for behavior and general courtesies. explore the 110 rules of civility Slavery Like most elite Americans, the Washingtons were deeply entangled in a global commercial system that revolved around slavery. The vast network of 18th-century transatlantic trade involved the flow of manufactured goods from Europe, enslaved people from Africa, and raw materials from the Americas. The economy and social structure of Washington\u2019s native Virginia depended on the labor of enslaved Africans and their descendants to cultivate cash crops like tobacco. Slavery was an integral part of Washington\u2019s life from an early age. At age 11, he inherited 10 enslaved people from his father. He would go on to inherit, purchase, rent, and gain control of more than 500 enslaved people at Mount Vernon and his other properties by the end of his life. When he married widow Martha Dandridge Custis in 1759, she brought 84 enslaved people to Mount Vernon as part of her \u201cdower share\u201d of her first husband\u2019s estate. She retained life rights to these people but did not legally own them. By 1799, the number of \u201cdower slaves\u201d at Mount Vernon had grown to 153 through natural increase, as children inherited the status of their mother. Washington\u2019s views on slavery changed over time. Economic and moral concerns led him to question slavery after the Revolutionary War, though he never lobbied publicly for abolition. Unable to extricate himself from slavery during his lifetime, Washington chose to free the 123 enslaved people he owned outright in his will. Learn More List of enslaved people at Mount Vernon, by George Washington, MVLA. Surveying During George Washington\u2019s early teenage years, he completed many school exercises in penmanship, comportment, and mathematics. Some exercises, such as the Art of Surveying and Measuring Land , provided instruction for practice surveys and included samples taken directly from William Leybourn's The Compleat Surveyor of 1657. The formal training Washington received in surveying was complemented by practical experience in the field. In the mid-1740s, Washington surveyed five acres for A Plan of a Piece of Meadow called Hell Hole, Situate on the Potowmack near Little Hunting Creek. Along with many other plats, Washington drew A Plan of Major Law[rence] Washington's Turnip Field. In 1748 Washington was invited to join a survey party organized by his neighbor and friend George William Fairfax of Belvoir. Fairfax assembled an experienced team to layout lots within a large tract along the western frontier of Virginia. Over their month-long expedition, Washington learned even more about surveying and gained important experience of living on the frontier. Washington's career as a professional surveyor began in 1749. He received a commission as a surveyor for the newly formed Culpeper County, probably at the behest of William Fairfax who was then serving on the Governor's Council. Learn More One of the most important tools of the trade was a surveyor's compass. When mounted on a staff, the compass enabled the user to establish a line from a known reference point to the point of interest and determine its bearing. MVLA [W-579/A-B] French and Indian War In 1753, the Governor of Virginia, Robert Dinwiddie, learned that French troops had moved south from Canada and were constructing forts in the region south of Lake Erie, an area claimed by the British (now in Western Pennsylvania). Both France and England recognized the commercial potential of the region. French trappers had been working in the area for some time. Dinwiddie was concerned that the French troops would also fortify the forks of the Ohio River -- the strategic point where the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers join to form the Ohio River. This point, now Pittsburgh, was the eastern gateway to the Ohio River Valley . Allegheny Expedition In the fall of 1753, Dinwiddie sent 21-year-old Major Washington to deliver a message to the French, demanding they leave the area. Today, this journey is known as the Allegheny Expedition and Washington was aided by Christopher Gist , a frontier guide, and local Native Americans . The\u00a0party finally reached the French post at Fort Le Boeuf on the evening of December 11, escorted by Seneca chief Tanacharison (Half-King), two Iroquois chiefs, and one from the Delaware Nation. The return trip tested Washington's endurance. He hiked for days through snowy woods, fell off a raft into the ice-choked Allegheny River, nearly drowned, and was forced to spend a freezing night on an island without shelter. Washington's account of the arduous 900-mile journey was published by Governor Dinwiddie in both Williamsburg and London, establishing an international reputation for George Washington by the time he was 22. Jumonville Glen Skirmish A few months later Dinwiddie dispatched Washington, now a lieutenant colonel, and some 150 men to assert Virginia's claims on the land. As they advanced, Washington's men skirmished with French soldiers, killing 10 men, including the French commander, Joseph Coulon de Villiers, Sieur de Jumonville. Washington then retreated to an ill-placed and makeshift palisade he called Fort Necessity . He was forced to surrender when the French surrounded the fort. The campaign ended in humiliation for Washington and ignited the French and Indian War . General Braddock Although he resigned his commission after the surrender, Washington returned to the frontier in 1755 as a volunteer aide to General Edward Braddock. Braddock had been sent by the King of England to drive the French from the Ohio Country. Braddock's army was routed near the Monongahela River and fled in confusion to Virginia. During the battle, while attempting to rally the British soldiers, Washington had two horses shot out from under him and four bullet holes shot through his coat. Although he behaved with conspicuous bravery, Washington could do little except lead the broken survivors to safety. In recognition of his conduct, Washington was given command of Virginia's entire military force. With a few hundred men he was ordered to protect a frontier some 350 miles long. Although this was a frustrating assignment, it provided him with experience in commanding troops through an arduous campaign. In 1758 the British finally took the forks of the Ohio. Peace returned to Virginia, and Washington resigned his commission to return to Mount Vernon, his duty faithfully performed. Learn More The Journal of Maj.

Learn more Marriage and Family Martha Washington served as the nation's first first lady and spent about half of the Revolutionary War at the front. She helped manage and run her husbands' estates. She raised her children, grandchildren, nieces, and nephews; and for almost 40 years she was George Washington's \"worthy partner\". On January 6, 1759, George Washington and Martha Dandridge Custis married , she was 27 years old and from the Tidewater area of Virginia. Martha was a widow and after the death of her first husband, Daniel Parke Custis , she assumed control of considerable property (in the form of land and enslaved people ). She also had two young children, John known as \u201cJacky\u201d and Martha called \u201cPatsy\u201d . In addition to seeing to her children's education, Martha oversaw the domestic staff of hired and enslaved butlers, housekeepers, maids, cooks, waiters, laundresses, spinners, seamstresses, and gardeners. These happy years at Mount Vernon were tragically interrupted, in 1773, when 17-year-old Patsy had a seizure and died. Revolutionary War During the Revolutionary War, George Washington was always leading the army, so Martha Washington along with the helped of her husband\u2019s cousin managed Mount Vernon. She also spent almost half of the war in camp ; entertaining visiting colonial and international officials and prominent civilians. She helped copy correspondences, knitted for the soldiers, and made hospital visits. As the war came to an end, much of the happiness was drowned out for Martha Washington by the loss of her son, John, who died of camp fever at Yorktown. First Family After the war, the Washingtons returned to Mount Vernon to rebuild their plantation and raise John\u2019s two youngest children, Eleanor and George . In 1789, the Washingtons, who were in their late 50s, became the first first family . Martha Washington oversaw much of the official entertaining, hosting a weekly dinner on Thursdays and a reception on Fridays, in addition to many other frequent visitors. Eight years later, the Washingtons retired to their beloved Mount Vernon. Over the next two years, they improved their home and welcomed many friends. Then on December 14, 1799, George Washington died. Martha Washington was devastated and told several people she was ready to join him in death. After an illness of several weeks, Martha Washington died on May 22, 1802. She was 70 years old. In newspapers throughout the country, Martha Washington was eulogized as \"the worthy partner of the worthiest of men.\" Learn More Martha Dandridge Custis, by Adrian Lamb, 1981, after John Wollaston (Mount Vernon Ladies\u2019 Association) The Life of Martha Washington This is the story of Martha Washington, the worthiest of partners to the worthiest of men. Entrepreneur George Washington spent the years between 1759 and 1775 overseeing the farms at Mount Vernon. Washington worked constantly to improve and expand the mansion house and its surrounding plantation. He established himself as an innovative farmer, who switched from tobacco to wheat as his main cash crop in the 1760's. In an effort to improve his farming operation , he diligently experimented with new crops, fertilizers, crop rotation, tools, and livestock breeding. He also expanded the work of the plantation to include flour milling and commercial fishing in an effort to make Mount Vernon a more profitable estate. Over the years, Washington had his house enlarged. First the roof was raised to create a third floor. Later a wing was added to each end, had a piazza built overlooking the Potomac River, and his vision was crowned with a cupola. By the time of his death in 1799, he had expanded the plantation from 2,000 to 8,000 acres consisting of five farms, with more than 3,000 acres under cultivation. Shortly after taking up wheat as his main cash crop, Washington built a large gristmill outfitted with two pairs of millstones. One pair of stones ground corn into meal for use at Mount Vernon and the other ground wheat into superfine flour for export to foreign ports. Washington also began making whiskey on the advice of his farm manager, James Anderson, a trained distiller from Scotland. He soon built one of the largest distilleries in America. At its peak, Washington\u2019s distillery produced over 11,000 gallons of rye whiskey, becoming one of his most successful enterprises. Even as President, Washington\u2019s thoughts often turned to Mount Vernon. For example, while in office, he designed a 16-sided barn to thresh wheat in a more efficient and sanitary way. As horses circled the second floor, they treaded on the wheat that had been spread there, breaking the grain from the chaff. The wheat would fall through gaps in the floorboards to the first floor, where it was winnowed. After winnowing, the grain was taken to the gristmill and ground into flour. From the President\u2019s House in Philadelphia, Washington followed the barn\u2019s construction every step of the way. He even correctly calculated the number of bricks needed for the first floor \u2013 which turned out to be exactly 30,820!

Watch the video Revolutionary War In June 1775, Congress commissioned George Washington to take command of the Continental Army besieging the British in Boston . He wrote home to Martha that he expected to return safely to her in the fall. The command kept him away from Mount Vernon for more than 8 years (with only one very brief visit while en route to Yorktown). It was a command for which his military background, although greater than that of any of the other available candidates, hardly prepared him. His knowledge lay in frontier warfare, involving relatively small numbers of soldiers. He had no practical experience maneuvering large formations, handling cavalry or artillery, or maintaining supply lines adequate to support thousands of men in the field. He learned on the job; and although his army reeled from one misfortune to another, he had the courage, determination, and mental agility to keep the American cause one step ahead of complete disintegration until he figured out how to win the unprecedented revolutionary struggle he was leading. His task was not overwhelming at first. The British position in Boston was untenable, and in March 1776 they withdrew from the city. But it was only a temporary respite. In June a new British army, under the command of Sir William Howe, arrived in the colonies with orders to take New York City. Howe commanded the largest expeditionary force Britain had ever sent overseas. Defending New York was almost impossible. An island city, New York is surrounded by a maze of waterways that gave a substantial advantage to an attacker with naval superiority. Howe's army was larger, better equipped, and far better trained than Washington's. They defeated Washington's army at Long Island in August and routed the Americans a few weeks later at Kip's Bay , resulting in the loss of the city. Forced to retreat northward, Washington was defeated again at White Plains. The American defense of New York City came to a humiliating conclusion on November 16, 1776, with the surrender of Fort Washington and some 2,800 men. Washington ordered his army to retreat across New Jersey. The remains of his forces, mud-soaked and exhausted, crossed the Delaware River into Pennsylvania on December 7. The British had good reason to believe that the American rebellion would be over in a few months and that Congress would seek peace rather than face complete subjugation of the colonies. The enlistments of most of Washington's army were due to expire at the end of December. However, instead of crushing the remains of Washington's army, Howe went into winter quarters, with advanced garrisons at\u00a0Trenton\u00a0and Princeton, leaving Washington open to execute one of the most daring military operations in American history. On Christmas night Washington's troops crossed the Delaware River and attacked the unsuspecting garrison at Trenton , forcing it to surrender.\u00a0A few days later Washington again crossed the Delaware, outmaneuvered the force sent to crush him, and fell on the enemy at Princeton, inflicting a humiliating loss on the British. For much of the remainder of the war, Washington's most important strategic task was to keep the British bottled up in New York. Although he never gave up hope of retaking the city, he was unwilling to risk his army without a fair prospect of success. An alliance with France and the arrival of a French army under the\u00a0Comte de Rochambeau\u00a0in July 1780 renewed Washington's hopes to recapture New York; however, together Washington and Rochambeau commanded about 9,000 men -- some 5,000 fewer than Clinton. In the end, therefore, the allied generals concluded, that an attack on New York could not succeed. Instead, they decided to strike at the British army under Cornwallis, which was camped at\u00a0Yorktown, Virginia. Washington's planning for the Battle of Yorktown was as bold as it had been for Trenton and Princeton but on a much larger scale. Depending on Clinton's inactivity, Washington marched south to lay siege on Cornwallis. On October 19, 1781, he accepted the surrender of Cornwallis's army. Although two more years passed before a peace treaty was completed, the victory at Yorktown effectively brought the Revolutionary War to an end. To the world's amazement, Washington had prevailed over the more numerous, better supplied, and fully-trained British army, mainly because he was more flexible than his opponents. He learned that it was more important to keep his army intact and to win an occasional victory to rally public support than it was to hold American cities or defeat the British army in an open field. Over the last 200 years, revolutionary leaders in every part of the world have employed this insight, but never with a result as startling as Washington's victory over the British. On December 23, 1783, Washington presented himself before Congress in Annapolis, Maryland, and resigned his commission. Like\u00a0Cincinnatus, the hero of Classical antiquity whose conduct he most admired, Washington had the wisdom to give up power when he could have been crowned a king. He left Annapolis and went home to Mount Vernon with the fixed intention of never again serving in public life. This one act, without precedent in modern history, made him an international hero.

So how did the United States, born of its own 8-year revolution, ultimately avoid these common pitfalls? Watch video series Constitutional Convention Although Washington longed for a peaceful life at Mount Vernon, the affairs of the nation continued to command his attention. He watched with mounting dismay as the weak union created by the Articles of Confederation gradually disintegrated, unable to collect revenue or pay its debts. He was appalled by the excesses of the state legislatures and frustrated by the diplomatic, financial, and military impotence of the Confederation Congress. By 1785 Washington had concluded that reform was essential. What was needed, he wrote to James Madison , was an energetic Constitution. In 1787, Washington ended his self-imposed retirement and traveled to Philadelphia to attend a convention assembled to recommend changes to the Articles of Confederation. He was unanimously chosen to preside over the Constitutional Convention , a job that took four months. He spoke very little in the convention, but few delegates were more determined to devise a government endowed with real energy and authority. My wish, he wrote, is that the convention may adopt no temporizing expedients but probe the defects of the Constitution to the bottom and provide a radical cure. After the convention adjourned, Washington's reputation and support were essential to overcome opposition to the ratification of the proposed Constitution. He worked for months to rally support for the new instrument of government. It was a difficult struggle. Even in Washington's native Virginia, the Constitution was ratified by a majority of only one vote. Once the Constitution was approved, Washington hoped to retire again to private life. But when the first presidential election was held, he received a vote from every elector. He remains the only President in American history to be elected by the unanimous voice of the people. Learn more Washington's World Interactive Map George Washington traveled far and wide during his lifetime. \u00a0Our Washington's World Interactive Map will help you discover all the journeys and places that Washington visited. See the Map President of the United States Washington served two terms as President. His first term (1789-1793) was occupied primarily with organizing the executive branch of the new government and establishing administrative procedures that would make it possible for the government to operate with the energy and efficiency he believed were essential to the republic's future. An astute judge of talent, he surrounded himself with the most able men in the new nation. He appointed his former aide-decamp, Alexander Hamilton , as Secretary of the Treasury; Thomas Jefferson as Secretary of State; and his former artillery chief, Henry Knox, as Secretary of War. James Madison was one of his principal advisors. In his First Inaugural Address , Washington confessed that he was unpracticed in the duties of civil administration; however, he was one of the most able administrators ever to serve as President. He administered the government with fairness and integrity, assuring Americans that the President could exercise extensive executive authority without corruption. Further, he executed the laws with restraint, establishing precedents for broad-ranging presidential authority. His integrity was most pure, Thomas Jefferson wrote, his justice the most inflexible I have ever known, no motive of interest or consanguinity, friendship, or hatred, being able to bias his decision. Washington set a standard for presidential integrity rarely met by his successors, although he established an ideal by which they all are judged. During Washington's first term the Federal Government adopted a series of measures proposed by Alexander Hamilton to resolve the escalating debt crisis and established the nation's finances on a sound basis, concluded peace treaties with the southeastern Indian tribes, and designated a site on the Potomac River for the permanent capital of the United States. But as Washington's first term ended, a bloody Indian war continued on the northwestern frontier. The warring tribes were encouraged by the British, who retained military posts in the northwest. Further, the Spanish denied Americans use of the Mississippi River. These problems limited the westward expansion to which Washington was committed. Growing partisanship within the government also concerned Washington. Many men in the new government -- including Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and other leaders of the emerging Republican party -- were opposed to Hamilton's financial program. Washington despised political partisanship but could do little to slow the development of political parties. During his first term Washington toured the northern and southern states and found that the new government enjoyed the general support of the American people. Convinced that the government could get along without him, he planned to step down at the end of his first term. But his cabinet members convinced him that he alone could command the respect of members of both burgeoning political parties. Thomas Jefferson visited Washington at Mount Vernon to urge him to accept a second term. Although longing to return home permanently, Washington reluctantly agreed. Washington's second term (1793-1797) was dominated by foreign affairs and marred by a deepening partisanship in his own administration. Washington assumed the Presidency on the eve of the French Revolution, a time of great international crisis. The outbreak of a general European war in 1793 forced the crisis to the center of American politics. Washington believed the national interest of the United States dictated neutrality. War would be disastrous for commerce and shatter the nation's finances. The country's future depended on the increase in wealth and opportunity that would come from commerce and westward expansion. One of Washington's most important accomplishments was keeping the United States out of the war, giving the new nation an opportunity to grow in strength while establishing the principle of neutrality that shaped American foreign policy for more than a century. Although Washington's department heads agreed that the United States should remain neutral, disagreements over foreign policy aggravated partisan tensions among them. The disagreements were part of the deepening division between Federalists and Republicans. Opposition to federal policies developed into resistance to the law in 1794 as distillers in Western Pennsylvania rioted and refused to pay taxes. Washington directed the army to restore order, a step applauded by Federalists and condemned by Republicans. Despite Washington's disappointment with the rise of partisanship, the last years of his Presidency were distinguished by important achievements. The long Indian war on the northwest frontier was won, Britain surrendered its forts in the northwest, and Spain opened the Mississippi to American commerce. These achievements opened the West to settlement. Washington\u2019s Farewell Address helped to summarize many of Washington\u2019s strongest held beliefs about what it would take to sustain and grow the young nation that he helped found.

Watch the video Retirement Finally retired from public service, George and Martha Washington returned to their beloved Mount Vernon where they would spend their final years. On Thursday, December 12, 1799, George Washington was out on horseback supervising farming activities from late morning until three in the afternoon. The weather shifted from light snow to hail and then to rain. Upon Washington's return it was suggested that he change out of his wet riding clothes before dinner. Known for his punctuality, Washington chose to remain in his damp attire. Washington recognized the onset of a sore throat and became increasingly hoarse. After retiring for the night Washington awoke in terrible discomfort at around two in the morning. Martha was concerned about his state and wanted to send for help. Tobias Lear, Washington\u2019s secretary, sent for George Rawlins, an overseer at Mount Vernon, who at the request of George Washington bled him. Lear also sent to Alexandria for Dr. James Craik , the family doctor and Washington's trusted friend and physician for forty years. As Washington\u2019s condition worsened, two additional doctors were sent for and arrived at Washington\u2019s bedside. Despite receiving a regimen of blood-lettings, induced vomiting, an enema, and potions of vinegar and sage tea, Washington\u2019s condition worsened. Washington called for his two wills and directed that the unused one should be burned. The Death of George Washington Between ten and eleven at night on December 14, 1799, George Washington passed away. He was surrounded by people who were close to him including his wife who sat at the foot of the bed, his friends Dr. Craik and Tobias Lear, enslaved housemaids Caroline Branham , Molly, and Charlotte , and his valet Christopher Sheels who stood in the room throughout the day. According to his wishes, Washington was not buried for three days. During that time his body lay in a mahogany casket in the New Room. On December 18, 1799 a solemn funeral was held at Mount Vernon and he was laid to rest in the family tomb . Washington's Will In his will, written several months before his death in December 1799, George Washington left directions for the emancipation of all the slaves that he owned, after the death of Martha Washington.

His life began in the countryside of Westmoreland County, Virginia on February 22, 1732. Born to Augustine and Mary Ball Washington, middle class farmers and plantation owners, \n                George learned about farming at a young age after the early death of his father. Also, the untimely death of his father prevented young George from advancing past an elementary level education. Looking to advance himself \n                vocationally and develop independence from his mother, George Washington became a surveyor for Culpeper County at the age of seventeen. This well-paying job was awarded to George mainly as a result of his connections \n                with the wealthy and influential Fairfax family, a connection that George possessed because of his older brother Lawrence's involvement in both the Ohio Company (a land company funded largely by the Fairfax family) \n                and the Virginia militia.  Following a trip to Barbados with Lawrence, George contracted smallpox. He survived, but Lawrence died soon after the trip as a result of tuberculosis. The death of Lawrence opened up leadership \n                positions in the Virginia milia; one of these open positions was given to George. Washington was now the the district adjutant militia leader for the Virginia militia. Shortly after Washington received his new military position, conflict arose between France and Great Britain over the claim to western lands in North America, specifically, land in the Ohio Country. The British investing \n                company known as the Ohio Company had laid claim to much land in the Ohio Valley. Because of the personal interests of several Ohio Company investors in Virginia and on orders from the government of Great Britain, \n                the governor of the colony of Virginia, Robert Dinwiddie, sent a militia group to the Ohio lands to request the leave of French forces that had gathered there.  George Washington graciously received the invitation \t\t\t\t\t\t\n                to lead this expedition.  After delivering the notice of claimed British lands to the French forces, Washington returned to Virginia. However, Governor Dinwiddie soon sent him back to the Ohio territory to oversee the \n                building of a British military fort.  While on his second expedition, Washington decided to attack a French militia unit under the command of Joseph de Jumonville. With the help of an Indian ally named Tanacharison, \n                Washington's men secured a hasty victory. Either during the battle or afterwards in the taking of prisoners, Jumonville was killed. A retaliation by the French led to the capture of Washington and much of his militia at Fort \n                Necessity; however, he was set free to return to Virginia soon afterwards. There was conjecture that Washington himself murdered the French commander or that he died at the hands of Tanacharison. Regardless, this incident \n                was crucial in beginning the French and Indian War between France and Great Britain in North America in 1756. During the French and Indian War, Washington saw action in battle at the Battle of the Monongahela. Serving as the chief American aide to the British General Edward Braddock, Washington rallied the British troops after an \n                ambush by French and Indian forces left many of the British officers dead or wounded and the troops in a state of disarray. His bravery and the fact that he narrowly escaped the battle unharmed himself (he was shot four \n                times through his coat and lost two horses from underneath him) helped to bolster Washington's reputation as a war hero. This resulted in Governor Dinwiddie appointing George Washington to Commander in Chief of the Virginia \n                militia. He spent most of his efforts as commander defending the Virginia frontier from hostile Indian attacks. Although he lost many men as a result of these expeditions, he did succeed in making the Virginia frontier one \n                of the safest among the colonies for settlers. Additionally, Washington served alongside the British army as the French and Indian conflict waged on. He was hardly successful in this, blundering his role in the Forbes \n                Expedition to capture the western French Fort Duquesne. He unwittingly led his troops to open fire on a British unit, leading to casualties from friendly fire. George Washington resigned from the Virginia militia after \n                this mistake, but still learned much from his early experiences in war, particularly the tactics of the British military with their strengths and weaknesses. Additionally, many of Washington's later political views were \n                first birthed during this time in his life: he recognized the need for a strong central government that had the ability to act quickly and definitively. Based on this belief, he would later come to espouse the political \n                views of the Federalist Party. Declaration of Independence Following his service in the French and Indian War, Washington returned to civilian life with his marriage to Martha Dandridge Custis, a wealthy widow. Not only did George Washington increase his wealth and the size of \n                his estate with this marriage, but also he became a father to Mary's children John Parke Custis and Martha Parke Custis. George and Martha never had any children of their own. Washington acquired even more land because \n                of his service in the French and Indian War; Governor Dinwiddie awarded over 20,000 acres of land in the Ohio territory to George Washington. With this significant increase in land and wealth, Washington rose in Virginian \n                society to the level of an aristocrat and became involved in local politics as a member of the Virginia House of Burgesses in 1758. Washington's involvement in politics, however, soon landed him back on the battlefield. After actively opposing the Stamp Act of 1765 and the Townshend Acts, Washington drew up a proposal to boycott British goods until the \n                repeal of these unfair taxes on the American colonies. Soon, the fighting with Great Britain became more than political. During the summer of 1775, Washington was appointed the Commander in Chief of the Continental Army by \n                the American colonies' legislative body, the Continental Congress. As Commander in Chief, Washington was responsible for leading the Continental army, training the army, and serving as the public face of the American Revolution. The American War for Independence began with the two skirmishes at Lexington and Concord. Washington was not directly involved in these preliminary battles, as he became Commander in Chief directly afterwards. Washington's \n                time as the commander of the colonial forces was full of both victories and significant defeats. At the beginning of the war, George Washington drove the British out of the major city of Boston, but then lost the great city \n                of New York shortly after. Following this great defeat, Washington gave life back to the colonial efforts by winning small battles at both Trenton and Princeton, New Jersey in December 1776. The next year, the British, \n                under the command of General Howe, defeated Washington's army at Philadelphia and captured the city that served as the rebel forces political capital. This significant loss prompted several members of the Continental Congress \n                to question Washington's competency as the leader of the Continental Army. Despite the doubts about Washington, enough support remained among the army and the political leaders of the colony for the commander to keep his title. \n                The winter of 1777 saw the colonial army encamped at Valley Forge, where they suffered massive casualties, mainly from disease. Following this bitter winter, Washington followed the British army as they evacuated the recently \n                captured city of Philadelphia to retreat to their stronghold at New York. Washington attempted to attack them at the Battle of Monmouth, but this proved to end in a stalemate. The winter of 1779-1780 was another difficult \n                season for Washington and his men. Supplies ran scarce once again, and the treason committed by Benedict Arnold became public. However, the next summer proved to be more successful. Aided by their ally France with both \n                ground troops and a naval force, George Washington delivered a decisive victory over the British in the Battle of Yorktown. A formal peace treaty was not signed until September 1783, the Treaty of Paris. Shortly thereafter, \n                Washington retired to his estate in Mount Vernon, Virginia to attend to his lands and farms. Scene at the Signing of the Constitution of the United States George Washington's retirement was brief, as he was called to the Constitutional Convention to assist in crafting a government for the newly independent colonies. Serving as the president of the Convention, he strongly \n                disapproved of the proposed Articles of Confederation, claiming that they would establish a weak central government for the new nation. Following the ratification of the Constitution (the replacement for the Articles \n                of Confederation), George Washington was unanimously elected as the first President of the United States of America in 1789. He reluctantly was elected to a second term in 1792. As the first U.S. President, George \n                Washington set many precedents: he opted to serve only two terms, he removed all royal \"flair\" from the office of President, he initiated public addresses to Congress, and he formed a cabinet of personal advisers to \n                assist him in making leadership decisions. Additionally, he tended to favor and promote the actions of a strong central federal government. For example, in 1794, Washington sent state militias to suppress what became \n                known as the Whiskey Rebellion, a protest to an excise tax on distilled spirits that had been implemented by Congress three years earlier. Both his show of force and his support of taxation by the central government proved \n                George Washington's support of the Federalist principles of strong federal government. In foreign affairs, Washington adopted a policy of diplomacy and neutrality throughout his presidency. After the end of his second \n                presidential term, Washington penned his Farewell Address, in which he urged the young nation to practice national unity, abide by the Constitution, uphold morality, and adopt international independence in foreign affairs. George Washington retired to his Mount Vernon home once again in 1797 upon the completion of his presidency and political career. He devoted most of his time to caring for and expanding his estate. However, he did accept \n                a military leadership position the following year as the senior officer of the United States Army as tensions with France heightened. On December 13, 1799, Washington came down with a severe sore throat and other cold-like \n                symptoms. His symptoms rapidly progressed, and doctors were called to his aide at his home. A believer in the ineffective medical practice of bloodletting, in which a sick patient is bled in order to rid the body of disease, \n                Washington allowed the three physicians attending to him to bleed almost half of his body's blood supply. When he died around 10:00 pm on December 14, it was most likely due to shock. George Washington's death was publicly \n                mourned not only in the United States but also in several European nations. The legacy of George Washington is one that will not be soon removed from both the iconic and factual history of the U.S.A. From his title as the \n                \"father of his country\" to his portrait on the American dollar to a monument constructed to his honor in America's capital city, George Washington was indeed \"first in war-first in peace-and first in the hearts of his \n                countrymen.\" Today, George Washington is recognized as the most admired U.S. president in history, along with Abraham Lincoln . \u00a9 Copyright www.GeorgeWashington.org All Rights Reserved Designed by www.GeorgeWashington.org"

Updated: Sep 11, 2020 3:35 PM EDT Photo: Gilbert Stuart/Public Domain via Wikimedia Commons (1732-1799) Who Was George Washington? George Washington was a Virginia plantation owner who served as a general and commander-in-chief of the colonial armies during the American Revolutionary War, and later became the first president of the United States, serving from 1789 to 1797. Early Life and Family Washington was born on February 22, 1732, in Westmoreland County, Virginia. He was the eldest of Augustine and Mary\u2019s six children, all of whom survived into adulthood. The family lived on Pope's Creek in Westmoreland County, Virginia. They were moderately prosperous members of Virginia's \"middling class.\" Washington could trace his family's presence in North America to his great-grandfather, John Washington, who migrated from England to Virginia. The family held some distinction in England and was granted land by Henry VIII . But much of the family\u2019s wealth in England was lost under the Puritan government of Oliver Cromwell .  In 1657 Washington\u2019s grandfather, Lawrence Washington, migrated to Virginia. Little information is available about the family in North America until Washington\u2019s father, Augustine, was born in 1694. Augustine Washington was an ambitious man who acquired land and enslaved people, built mills, and grew tobacco. For a time, he had an interest in opening iron mines. He married his first wife, Jane Butler, and they had three children. Jane died in 1729 and Augustine married Mary Ball in 1731. Mount Vernon In 1735, Augustine moved the family up the Potomac River to another Washington family home, Little Hunting Creek Plantation \u2014 later renamed Mount Vernon . They moved again in 1738 to Ferry Farm on the Rappahannock River, opposite Fredericksburg, Virginia, where Washington spent much of his youth. Childhood and Education Little is known about Washington's childhood, which fostered many of the fables later biographers manufactured to fill in the gap. Among these are the stories that Washington threw a silver dollar across the Potomac and after chopping down his father's prize cherry tree, he openly confessed to the crime. It is known that from age seven to 15, Washington was home-schooled and studied with the local church sexton and later a schoolmaster in practical math, geography, Latin and the English classics. But much of the knowledge he would use the rest of his life was through his acquaintance with woodsmen and the plantation foreman. By his early teens, he had mastered growing tobacco, stock raising and surveying. Washington\u2019s father died when he was 11 and he became the ward of his half-brother, Lawrence, who gave him a good upbringing. Lawrence had inherited the family's Little Hunting Creek Plantation and married Anne Fairfax, the daughter of Colonel William Fairfax, patriarch of the well-to-do Fairfax family. Under her tutelage, Washington was schooled in the finer aspects of colonial culture. In 1748, when he was 16, Washington traveled with a surveying party plotting land in Virginia\u2019s western territory. The following year, aided by Lord Fairfax, Washington received an appointment as the official surveyor of Culpeper County. For two years he was very busy surveying the land in Culpeper, Frederick and Augusta counties. The experience made him resourceful and toughened his body and mind. It also piqued his interest in western land holdings, an interest that endured throughout his life with speculative land purchases and a belief that the future of the nation lay in colonizing the West. In July 1752, Washington's brother, Lawrence, died of tuberculosis, making him the heir apparent of the Washington lands. Lawrence\u2019s only child, Sarah, died two months later and Washington became the head of one of Virginia's most prominent estates, Mount Vernon. He was 20 years old. Throughout his life, he would hold farming as one of the most honorable professions and he was most proud of Mount Vernon. Washington would gradually increase his landholdings there to about 8,000 acres Pre-Revolutionary Military Career In the early 1750s, France and Britain were at peace. However, the French military had begun occupying much of the Ohio Valley, protecting the King's land interests, particularly fur trappers and French settlers. But the borderlands of this area were unclear and prone to dispute between the two countries. Washington showed early signs of natural leadership and shortly after Lawrence's death, Virginia's Lieutenant Governor, Robert Dinwiddie, appointed Washington adjutant with a rank of major in the Virginia militia. French and Indian War On October 31, 1753, Dinwiddie sent Washington to Fort LeBoeuf, at what is now Waterford, Pennsylvania, to warn the French to remove themselves from land claimed by Britain. The French politely refused and Washington made a hasty ride back to Williamsburg, Virginia's colonial capital. Dinwiddie sent Washington back with troops and they set up a post at Great Meadows. Washington's small force attacked a French post at Fort Duquesne, killing the commander, Coulon de Jumonville, and nine others and taking the rest prisoners. The French and Indian War had begun. The French counterattacked and drove Washington and his men back to his post at Great Meadows (later named \"Fort Necessity.\") After a full day siege, Washington surrendered and was soon released and returned to Williamsburg, promising not to build another fort on the Ohio River. Though a little embarrassed at being captured, he was grateful to receive the thanks from the House of Burgesses and see his name mentioned in the London gazettes. Washington was given the honorary rank of colonel and joined British General Edward Braddock's army in Virginia in 1755. The British had devised a plan for a three-prong assault on French forces attacking Fort Duquesne, Fort Niagara and Crown Point. During the encounter, the French and their Indian allies ambushed Braddock, who was mortally wounded. Washington escaped injury with four bullet holes in his cloak and two horses shot out from under him. Though he fought bravely, he could do little to turn back the rout and led the defeated army back to safety. Commander of Virginia Troops In August 1755, Washington was made commander of all Virginia troops at age 23. He was sent to the frontier to patrol and protect nearly 400 miles of border with some 700 ill-disciplined colonial troops and a Virginia colonial legislature unwilling to support him. It was a frustrating assignment. His health failed in the closing months of 1757 and he was sent home with dysentery. In 1758, Washington returned to duty on another expedition to capture Fort Duquesne. A friendly-fire incident took place, killing 14 and wounding 26 of Washington's men. However, the British were able to score a major victory, capturing Fort Duquesne and control of the Ohio Valley. Washington retired from his Virginia regiment in December 1758. His experience during the war was generally frustrating, with key decisions made slowly, poor support from the colonial legislature and poorly trained recruits. Washington applied for a commission with the British army but was turned down. In 1758, he resigned his commission and returned to Mount Vernon disillusioned. The same year, he entered politics and was elected to Virginia's House of Burgesses. Martha Washington A month after leaving the army, Washington married Martha Dandridge Custis, a widow, who was only a few months older than he. Martha brought to the marriage a considerable fortune: an 18,000-acre estate, from which Washington personally acquired 6,000 acres. With this and land he was granted for his military service, Washington became one of the more wealthy landowners in Virginia. The marriage also brought Martha's two young children, John (Jacky) and Martha (Patsy), ages six and four, respectively. Washington lavished great affection on both of them, and was heartbroken when Patsy died just before the Revolution. Jacky died during the Revolution, and Washington adopted two of his children. Enslaved People During his retirement from the Virginia militia until the start of the Revolution, Washington devoted himself to the care and development of his land holdings, attending the rotation of crops, managing livestock and keeping up with the latest scientific advances. By the 1790s, Washington kept over 300 enslaved people at Mount Vernon. He was said to dislike the institution of slavery , but accepted the fact that it was legal. Washington, in his will, made his displeasure with slavery known, as he ordered that all his enslaved people be granted their freedom upon the death of his wife Martha. (This act of generosity, however, applied to fewer than half of Mount Vernon's enslaved people: Those enslaved people owned by the Custis family were given to Martha\u2019s grandchildren after her death.) Washington loved the landed gentry's life of horseback riding, fox hunts, fishing and cotillions. He worked six days a week, often taking off his coat and performing manual labor with his workers. He was an innovative and responsible landowner, breeding cattle and horses and tending to his fruit orchards. Teeth Much has been made of the fact that Washington used false teeth or dentures for most of his adult life. Indeed, Washington's correspondence to friends and family makes frequent references to aching teeth, inflamed gums and various dental woes. Washington had one tooth pulled when he was just 24 years old, and by the time of his inauguration in 1789 he had just one natural tooth left. But his false teeth weren't made of wood, as some legends suggest. Instead, Washington's false teeth were fashioned from human teeth \u2014 including teeth from enslaved people and his own pulled teeth \u2014 ivory, animal teeth and assorted metals. Washington's dental problems, according to some historians, probably impacted the shape of his face and may have contributed to his quiet, somber demeanor: During the Constitutional Convention, Washington addressed the gathered dignitaries only once. American Revolution Though the British Proclamation Act of 1763 \u2014 prohibiting settlement beyond the Alleghenies \u2014 irritated Washington and he opposed the Stamp Act of 1765, he did not take a leading role in the growing colonial resistance against the British until the widespread protest of the Townshend Acts in 1767. His letters of this period indicate he was totally opposed to the colonies declaring independence. However, by 1767, he wasn't opposed to resisting what he believed were fundamental violations by the Crown of the rights of Englishmen. In 1769, Washington introduced a resolution to the House of Burgesses calling for Virginia to boycott British goods until the Acts were repealed. After the passage of the Coercive Acts in 1774, Washington chaired a meeting in which the Fairfax Resolves were adopted, calling for the convening of the Continental Congress and the use of armed resistance as a last resort. He was selected as a delegate to the First Continental Congress in March 1775. Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army After the battles of Lexington and Concord in April 1775, the political dispute between Great Britain and her North American colonies escalated into an armed conflict. In May, Washington traveled to the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia dressed in a military uniform, indicating that he was prepared for war. On June 15th, he was appointed Major General and Commander-in-Chief of the colonial forces against Great Britain. As was his custom, he did not seek out the office of commander, but he faced no serious competition. Washington was the best choice for a number of reasons: he had the prestige, military experience and charisma for the job and he had been advising Congress for months. Another factor was political: The Revolution had started in New England and at the time, they were the only colonies that had directly felt the brunt of British tyranny. Virginia was the largest British colony and New England needed Southern colonial support. Political considerations and force of personality aside, Washington was not necessarily qualified to wage war on the world's most powerful nation. Washington's training and experience were primarily in frontier warfare involving small numbers of soldiers. He wasn't trained in the open-field style of battle practiced by the commanding British generals. He also had no practical experience maneuvering large formations of infantry, commanding cavalry or artillery, or maintaining the flow of supplies for thousands of men in the field. But he was courageous and determined and smart enough to keep one step ahead of the enemy. Washington and his small army did taste victory early in March 1776 by placing artillery above Boston, on Dorchester Heights, forcing the British to withdraw. Washington then moved his troops into New York City. But in June, a new British commander, Sir William Howe , arrived in the Colonies with the largest expeditionary force Britain had ever deployed to date. Crossing the Delaware In August 1776, the British army launched an attack and quickly took New York City in the largest battle of the war. Washington's army was routed and suffered the surrender of 2,800 men. He ordered the remains of his army to retreat into Pennsylvania across the Delaware River. Confident the war would be over in a few months, General Howe wintered his troops at Trenton and Princeton, leaving Washington free to attack at the time and place of his choosing. On Christmas night, 1776, Washington and his men returned across the Delaware River and attacked unsuspecting Hessian mercenaries at Trenton, forcing their surrender. A few days later, evading a force that had been sent to destroy his army, Washington attacked the British again, this time at Princeton, dealing them a humiliating loss. Victories and Losses General Howe's strategy was to capture colonial cities and stop the rebellion at key economic and political centers. He never abandoned the belief that once the Americans were deprived of their major cities, the rebellion would wither. In the summer of 1777, he mounted an offensive against Philadelphia. Washington moved in his army to defend the city but was defeated at the Battle of Brandywine . Philadelphia fell two weeks later. In the late summer of 1777, the British army sent a major force, under the command of John Burgoyne, south from Quebec to Saratoga, New York, to split the rebellion between New England and the southern colonies. But the strategy backfired, as Burgoyne became trapped by the American armies led by Horatio Gates and Benedict Arnold at the Battle of Saratoga . Without support from Howe, who couldn't reach him in time, Burgoyne was forced to surrender his entire 6,200 man army. The victory was a major turning point in the war as it encouraged France to openly ally itself with the American cause for independence. Through all of this, Washington discovered an important lesson: The political nature of war was just as important as the military one. Washington began to understand that military victories were as important as keeping the resistance alive. Americans began to believe that they could meet their objective of independence without defeating the British army. Meanwhile, British General Howe clung to the strategy of capturing colonial cities in hopes of smothering the rebellion. Howe didn't realize that capturing cities like Philadelphia and New York would not unseat colonial power. The Congress would just pack up and meet elsewhere. Valley Forge The darkest time for Washington and the Continental Army was during the winter of 1777 at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania. The 11,000-man force went into winter quarters and over the next six months suffered thousands of deaths, mostly from disease. But the army emerged from the winter still intact and in relatively good order. Realizing their strategy of capturing colonial cities had failed, the British command replaced General Howe with Sir Henry Clinton. The British army evacuated Philadelphia to return to New York City. Washington and his men delivered several quick blows to the moving army, attacking the British flank near Monmouth Courthouse. Though a tactical standoff, the encounter proved Washington's army capable of open field battle. For the remainder of the war, Washington was content to keep the British confined to New York, although he never totally abandoned the idea of retaking the city. The alliance with France had brought a large French army and a navy fleet. Washington and his French counterparts decided to let Clinton be and attack British General Charles Cornwallis at Yorktown, Virginia. Facing the combined French and Colonial armies and the French fleet of 29 warships at his back, Cornwallis held out as long as he could, but on October 19, 1781, he surrendered his forces. Revolutionary War Victory Washington had no way of knowing the Yorktown victory would bring the war to a close. The British still had 26,000 troops occupying New York City, Charleston and Savannah, plus a large fleet of warships in the Colonies. By 1782, the French army and navy had departed, the Continental treasury was depleted, and most of his soldiers hadn\u2019t been paid for several years. A near-mutiny was avoided when Washington convinced Congress to grant a five-year bonus for soldiers in March 1783. By November of that year, the British had evacuated New York City and other cities and the war was essentially over. The Americans had won their independence. Washington formally bade his troops farewell and on December 23, 1783, he resigned his commission as commander-in-chief of the army and returned to Mount Vernon. For four years, Washington attempted to fulfill his dream of resuming life as a gentleman farmer and to give his much-neglected Mount Vernon plantation the care and attention it deserved. The war had been costly to the Washington family with lands neglected, no exports of goods, and the depreciation of paper money. But Washington was able to repair his fortunes with a generous land grant from Congress for his military service and become profitable once again. Constitutional Convention In 1787, Washington was again called to the duty of his country. Since independence, the young republic had been struggling under the Articles of Confederation , a structure of government that centered power with the states. But the states were not unified. They fought among themselves over boundaries and navigation rights and refused to contribute to paying off the nation's war debt. In some instances, state legislatures imposed tyrannical tax policies on their own citizens. Washington was intensely dismayed at the state of affairs, but only slowly came to the realization that something should be done about it. Perhaps he wasn't sure the time was right so soon after the Revolution to be making major adjustments to the democratic experiment. Or perhaps because he hoped he would not be called upon to serve, he remained noncommittal. But when Shays' Rebellion erupted in Massachusetts, Washington knew something needed to be done to improve the nation\u2019s government. In 1786, Congress approved a convention to be held in Philadelphia to amend the Articles of Confederation. At the Constitutional Convention , Washington was unanimously chosen as president. Washington, James Madison and Alexander Hamilton had come to the conclusion that it wasn't amendments that were needed, but a new constitution that would give the national government more authority. In the end, the Convention produced a plan for government that not only would address the country's current problems, but would endure through time. After the convention adjourned, Washington's reputation and support for the new government were indispensable to the ratification of the new U.S. Constitution . The opposition was strident, if not organized, with many of America's leading political figures \u2014 including Patrick Henry and Sam Adams \u2014 condemning the proposed government as a grab for power. Even in Washington's native Virginia, the Constitution was ratified by only one vote. DOWNLOAD BIOGRAPHY'S GEORGE WASHINGTON FACT CARD George Washington: Presidency Still hoping to retire to his beloved Mount Vernon, Washington was once again called upon to serve this country. During the presidential election of 1789, he received a vote from every elector to the Electoral College, the only president in American history to be elected by unanimous approval. He took the oath of office at Federal Hall in New York City, the capital of the United States at the time. As the first president, Washington was astutely aware that his presidency would set a precedent for all that would follow. He carefully attended to the responsibilities and duties of his office, remaining vigilant to not emulate any European royal court. To that end, he preferred the title \"Mr. President,\" instead of more imposing names that were suggested. At first he declined the $25,000 salary Congress offered the office of the presidency, for he was already wealthy and wanted to protect his image as a selfless public servant. However, Congress persuaded him to accept the compensation to avoid giving the impression that only wealthy men could serve as president. Washington proved to be an able administrator. He surrounded himself with some of the most capable people in the country, appointing Hamilton as Secretary of the Treasury and Thomas Jefferson as Secretary of State. He delegated authority wisely and consulted regularly with his cabinet listening to their advice before making a decision. Washington established broad-ranging presidential authority, but always with the highest integrity, exercising power with restraint and honesty. In doing so, he set a standard rarely met by his successors, but one that established an ideal by which all are judged. READ MORE: How George Washington\u2019s Personal and Physical Characteristics Helped Him Win the Presidency Accomplishments During his first term, Washington adopted a series of measures proposed by Treasury Secretary Hamilton to reduce the nation's debt and place its finances on sound footing. His administration also established several peace treaties with Native American tribes and approved a bill establishing the nation's capital in a permanent district along the Potomac River. Whiskey Rebellion Then, in 1791, Washington signed a bill authorizing Congress to place a tax on distilled spirits, which stirred protests in rural areas of Pennsylvania. Quickly, the protests turned into a full-scale defiance of federal law known as the Whiskey Rebellion . Washington invoked the Militia Act of 1792, summoning local militias from several states to put down the rebellion. Washington personally took command, marching the troops into the areas of rebellion and demonstrating that the federal government would use force, when necessary, to enforce the law. This was also the only time a sitting U.S. president has led troops into battle. Jay Treaty In foreign affairs, Washington took a cautious approach, realizing that the weak young nation could not succumb to Europe's political intrigues. In 1793, France and Great Britain were once again at war. At the urging of Hamilton, Washington disregarded the U.S. alliance with France and pursued a course of neutrality. In 1794, he sent John Jay to Britain to negotiate a treaty (known as the \"Jay Treaty\") to secure a peace with Britain and clear up some issues held over from the Revolutionary War. The action infuriated Jefferson, who supported the French and felt that the U.S. needed to honor its treaty obligations. Washington was able to mobilize public support for the treaty, which proved decisive in securing ratification in the Senate. Though controversial, the treaty proved beneficial to the United States by removing British forts along the western frontier, establishing a clear boundary between Canada and the United States, and most importantly, delaying a war with Britain and providing over a decade of prosperous trade and development the fledgling country so desperately needed. Political Parties All through his two terms as president, Washington was dismayed at the growing partisanship within the government and the nation. The power bestowed on the federal government by the Constitution made for important decisions, and people joined together to influence those decisions. The formation of political parties at first were influenced more by personality than by issues. As Treasury secretary, Hamilton pushed for a strong national government and an economy built in industry. Secretary of State Jefferson desired to keep government small and center power more at the local level, where citizens' freedom could be better protected. He envisioned an economy based on farming. Those who followed Hamilton's vision took the name Federalists and people who opposed those ideas and tended to lean toward Jefferson\u2019s view began calling themselves Democratic-Republicans. Washington despised political partisanship, believing that ideological differences should never become institutionalized. He strongly felt that political leaders should be free to debate important issues without being bound by party loyalty. However, Washington could do little to slow the development of political parties. The ideals promoted by Hamilton and Jefferson produced a two-party system that proved remarkably durable. These opposing viewpoints represented a continuation of the debate over the proper role of government, a debate that began with the conception of the Constitution and continues today. Washington's administration was not without its critics who questioned what they saw as extravagant conventions in the office of the president. During his two terms, Washington rented the best houses available and was driven in a coach drawn by four horses, with outriders and lackeys in rich uniforms. After being overwhelmed by callers, he announced that except for the scheduled weekly reception open to all, he would only see people by appointment. Washington entertained lavishly, but in private dinners and receptions at invitation only. He was, by some, accused of conducting himself like a king. However, ever mindful his presidency would set the precedent for those to follow, he was careful to avoid the trappings of a monarchy. At public ceremonies, he did not appear in a military uniform or the monarchical robes. Instead, he dressed in a black velvet suit with gold buckles and powdered hair, as was the common custom. His reserved manner was more due to inherent reticence than any excessive sense of dignity. Retirement Desiring to return to Mount Vernon and his farming, and feeling the decline of his physical powers with age, Washington refused to yield to the pressures to serve a third term, even though he would probably not have faced any opposition. By doing this, he was again mindful of the precedent of being the \"first president,\" and chose to establish a peaceful transition of government. Farewell Address In the last months of his presidency, Washington felt he needed to give his country one last measure of himself. With the help of Hamilton, he composed his Farewell Address to the American people, which urged his fellow citizens to cherish the Union and avoid partisanship and permanent foreign alliances. In March 1797, he turned over the government to John Adams and returned to Mount Vernon, determined to live his last years as a simple gentleman farmer. His last official act was to pardon the participants in the Whiskey Rebellion. Upon returning to Mount Vernon in the spring of 1797, Washington felt a reflective sense of relief and accomplishment. He had left the government in capable hands, at peace, its debts well-managed, and set on a course of prosperity. He devoted much of his time to tending the farm's operations and management. Although he was perceived to be wealthy, his land holdings were only marginally profitable. Death On a cold December day in 1799, Washington spent much of it inspecting the farm on horseback in a driving snowstorm. When he returned home, he hastily ate his supper in his wet clothes and then went to bed. The next morning, on December 13, he awoke with a severe sore throat and became increasingly hoarse. He retired early, but awoke around 3 a.m. and told Martha that he felt very sick. The illness progressed until he died late in the evening of December 14, 1799. The news of Washington's death at age 67 spread throughout the country, plunging the nation into a deep mourning. Many towns and cities held mock funerals and presented hundreds of eulogies to honor their fallen hero. When the news of this death reached Europe, the British fleet paid tribute to his memory, and Napoleon ordered ten days of mourning. Legacy Washington could have been a king. Instead, he chose to be a citizen. He set many precedents for the national government and the presidency: The two-term limit in office, only broken once by Franklin D. Roosevelt , was later ensconced in the Constitution's 22nd Amendment. He crystallized the power of the presidency as a part of the government\u2019s three branches of government , able to exercise authority when necessary, but also accept the checks and balances of power inherent in the system. He was not only considered a military and revolutionary hero, but a man of great personal integrity, with a deep sense of duty, honor and patriotism. For over 200 years, Washington has been acclaimed as indispensable to the success of the Revolution and the birth of the nation. But his most important legacy may be that he insisted he was dispensable, asserting that the cause of liberty was larger than any single individual.

When we assumed the soldier, we did not lay aside the citizen. Be courteous to all, but intimate with few. [T]he preservation of the sacred fire of liberty, and the destiny of the republican model of government, are justly considered as deeply, perhaps as finally staked, on the experiment entrusted to the hands of the American people. We should never despair, our situation before has been unpromising and has changed for the better, so I trust, it will again. If new difficulties arise, we must only put forth new exertions and proportion our efforts to the exigency of the times. There can be no greater error than to expect or calculate upon real favors from nation to nation. [M]y movements to the chair of government will be accompanied by feelings not unlike those of a culprit who is going to the place of his execution. True friendship is a plant of slow growth, and must undergo and withstand the shocks of adversity before it is entitled to the appellation. Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports. I heard the bullets whistle, and, believe me, there is something charming in the sound. Discipline is the soul of an army. It makes small numbers formidable; procures success to the weak, and esteem to all. The basis of our political Systems is the right of the people to make and to alter their Constitutions of Government. But the Constitution which at any time exists, 'till changed by an explicit and authentic act of the whole People, is sacredly obligatory upon all. I hold the maxim no less applicable to public than to private affairs,  that honesty is the best policy. The bosom of America is open to  receive not only the opulent and respectable stranger, but the oppressed  and persecuted of all nations and religions.

The son of a prosperous planter, Washington was raised in colonial Virginia. As a young man, he worked as a surveyor then fought in the French and Indian War (1754-63). During the American Revolution, he led the colonial forces to victory over the British and became a national hero. In 1787, he was elected president of the convention that wrote the U.S. Constitution. Two years later, Washington became America\u2019s first president. Realizing that the way he handled the job would impact how future presidents approached the position, he handed down a legacy of strength, integrity and national purpose. Less than three years after leaving office, he died at his Virginia plantation, Mount Vernon, at age 67. George Washington's Early Years George Washington How did George Washington turn a rag-tag group of men into a disciplined fighting machine? George Washington was born on February 22, 1732 , at his family\u2019s plantation on Pope\u2019s Creek in Westmoreland County, in the British colony of Virginia , to Augustine Washington (1694-1743) and his second wife, Mary Ball Washington (1708-89). George, the eldest of Augustine and Mary Washington\u2019s six children, spent much of his childhood at Ferry Farm, a plantation near Fredericksburg, Virginia. After Washington\u2019s father died when he was 11, it\u2019s likely he helped his mother manage the plantation. Did you know? At the time of his death in 1799, George Washington owned some 300 enslaved people. However, before his passing, he had become opposed to slavery, and in his will, he ordered that his enslaved workers be freed after his wife's death. Few details about Washington\u2019s early education are known, although children of prosperous families like his typically were taught at home by private tutors or attended private schools. It\u2019s believed he finished his formal schooling at around age 15. As a teenager, Washington, who had shown an aptitude for mathematics, became a successful surveyor. His surveying expeditions into the Virginia wilderness earned him enough money to begin acquiring land of his own. In 1751, Washington made his only trip outside of America, when he traveled to Barbados with his older half-brother Lawrence Washington (1718-52), who was suffering from tuberculosis and hoped the warm climate would help him recuperate. Shortly after their arrival, George contracted smallpox. He survived, although the illness left him with permanent facial scars. In 1752, Lawrence, who had been educated in England and served as Washington\u2019s mentor, died. Washington eventually inherited Lawrence\u2019s estate, Mount Vernon , on the Potomac River near Alexandria, Virginia. An Officer and Gentleman Farmer In December 1752, Washington, who had no previous military experience, was made a commander of the Virginia militia. He saw action in the French and Indian War and was eventually put in charge of all of Virginia\u2019s militia forces. By 1759, Washington had resigned his commission, returned to Mount Vernon and was elected to the Virginia House of Burgesses, where he served until 1774. In January 1759, he married Martha Dandridge Custis (1731-1802), a wealthy widow with two children. Washington became a devoted stepfather to her children; he and Martha Washington never had any offspring of their own. The French and Indian War The French and Indian War saw two European imperialists go head-to-head over territory and marked the debut of the soldier who would become America's first president. In the ensuing years, Washington expanded Mount Vernon from 2,000 acres into an 8,000-acre property with five farms. He grew a variety of crops, including wheat and corn, bred mules and maintained fruit orchards and a successful fishery. He was deeply interested in farming and continually experimented with new crops and methods of land conservation. George Washington During the American Revolution Washington proved to be a better general than military strategist. His strength lay not in his genius on the battlefield but in his ability to keep the struggling colonial army together. His troops were poorly trained and lacked food, ammunition and other supplies (soldiers sometimes even went without shoes in winter). However, Washington was able to give them direction and motivation. His leadership during the winter of 1777-1778 at Valley Forge was a testament to his power to inspire his men to keep going. By the late 1760s, Washington had experienced firsthand the effects of rising taxes imposed on American colonists by the British and came to believe that it was in the best interests of the colonists to declare independence from England. Washington served as a delegate to the First Continental Congress in 1774 in Philadelphia. By the time the Second Continental Congress convened a year later, the American Revolution had begun in earnest, and Washington was named commander in chief of the Continental Army. Over the course of the grueling eight-year war, the colonial forces won few battles but consistently held their own against the British. In October 1781, with the aid of the French (who allied themselves with the colonists over their rivals the British), the Continental forces were able to capture British troops under General Charles Cornwallis (1738-1805) in the Battle of Yorktown . This action effectively ended the Revolutionary War and Washington was declared a national hero. America\u2019s First President George Washington Greatest Challenges After George Washington took office on April 30, 1789, at Federal Hall in New York City, a variety of challenges, he was faced with a variety of tough challenges, both foreign and domestic. In 1783, with the signing of the Treaty of Paris between Great Britain and the U.S., Washington, believing he had done his duty, gave up his command of the army and returned to Mount Vernon, intent on resuming his life as a gentleman farmer and family man. However, in 1787, he was asked to attend the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia and head the committee to draft the new constitution . His impressive leadership there convinced the delegates that he was by far the most qualified man to become the nation\u2019s first president. At first, Washington balked. He wanted to, at last, return to a quiet life at home and leave governing the new nation to others. But public opinion was so strong that eventually he gave in. The first presidential election was held on January 7, 1789, and Washington won handily. John Adams (1735-1826), who received the second-largest number of votes, became the nation\u2019s first vice president. The 57-year-old Washington was inaugurated on April 30, 1789, in New York City. Because Washington, D.C. , America\u2019s future capital city wasn\u2019t yet built, he lived in New York and Philadelphia. While in office, he signed a bill establishing a future, permanent U.S. capital along the Potomac River\u2014the city later named Washington, D.C., in his honor. George Washington\u2019s Accomplishments The United States was a small nation when Washington took office, consisting of 11 states and approximately 4 million people, and there was no precedent for how the new president should conduct domestic or foreign business. Mindful that his actions would likely determine how future presidents were expected to govern, Washington worked hard to set an example of fairness, prudence and integrity. In foreign matters, he supported cordial relations with other countries but also favored a position of neutrality in foreign conflicts. Domestically, he nominated the first chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court , John Jay (1745-1829), signed a bill establishing the first national bank, the Bank of the United States , and set up his own presidential cabinet . His two most prominent cabinet appointees were Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson (1743-1826) and Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton (1755-1804), two men who disagreed strongly on the role of the federal government. Hamilton favored a strong central government and was part of the Federalist Party , while Jefferson favored stronger states\u2019 rights as part of the Democratic-Republican Party, the forerunner to the Democratic Party . Washington believed that divergent views were critical for the health of the new government, but he was distressed at what he saw as an emerging partisanship. George Washington\u2019s presidency was marked by a series of firsts. He signed the first United States copyright law, protecting the copyrights of authors. He also signed the first Thanksgiving proclamation, making November 26 a national day of Thanksgiving for the end of the war for American independence and the successful ratification of the Constitution. During Washington\u2019s presidency, Congress passed the first federal revenue law, a tax on distilled spirits. In July 1794, farmers in Western Pennsylvania rebelled over the so-called \u201cwhiskey tax.\u201d Washington called in over 12,000 militiamen to Pennsylvania to dissolve the Whiskey Rebellion in one of the first major tests of the authority of the national government. Under Washington\u2019s leadership, the states ratified the Bill of Rights , and five new states entered the union: North Carolina (1789), Rhode Island (1790), Vermont (1791), Kentucky (1792) and Tennessee (1796). In his second term, Washington issued the proclamation of neutrality to avoid entering the 1793 war between Great Britain and France. But when French minister to the United States Edmond Charles Genet\u2014known to history as \u201cCitizen Genet\u201d\u2014toured the United States, he boldly flaunted the proclamation, attempting to set up American ports as French military bases and gain support for his cause in the Western United States. His meddling caused a stir between Federalists and Democratic-Republicans, widening the rift between parties and making consensus-building more difficult. In 1795, Washington signed the \u201cTreaty of Amity Commerce and Navigation, between His Britannic Majesty; and The United States of America,\u201d or Jay\u2019s Treaty , so-named for John Jay , who had negotiated it with the government of King George III . It helped the U.S. avoid war with Great Britain, but also rankled certain members of Congress back home and was fiercely opposed by Thomas Jefferson and James Madison . Internationally, it caused a stir among the French, who believed it violated previous treaties between the United States and France. Washington\u2019s administration signed two other influential international treaties. Pinckney\u2019s Treaty of 1795, also known as the Treaty of San Lorenzo, established friendly relations between the United States and Spain, firming up borders between the U.S. and Spanish territories in North America and opening up the Mississippi to American traders. The Treaty of Tripoli, signed the following year, gave American ships access to Mediterranean shipping lanes in exchange for a yearly tribute to the Pasha of Tripoli. George Washington\u2019s Retirement to Mount Vernon and Death George Washington's Dogs George Washington wasn't just the first president of the U.S. - he also loved dogs, and even created a new dog breed! In 1796, after two terms as president and declining to serve a third term, Washington finally retired. In Washington\u2019s farewell address , he urged the new nation to maintain the highest standards domestically and to keep involvement with foreign powers to a minimum. The address is still read each February in the U.S. Senate to commemorate Washington\u2019s birthday. Washington returned to Mount Vernon and devoted his attentions to making the plantation as productive as it had been before he became president. More than four decades of public service had aged him, but he was still a commanding figure. In December 1799, he caught a cold after inspecting his properties in the rain. The cold developed into a throat infection and Washington died on the night of December 14, 1799, at the age of 67. He was entombed at Mount Vernon, which in 1960 was designated a national historic landmark. Washington left one of the most enduring legacies of any American in history. Known as the \u201cFather of His Country,\u201d his face appears on the U.S. dollar bill and quarter, and dozens of U.S. schools, towns and counties, as well as the state of Washington and the nation\u2019s capital city, are named for him.

On April 30, 1789, George Washington, standing on the balcony of Federal Hall on Wall Street in New York, took his oath of office as the first President of the United States. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs the first of every thing, in our situation will serve to establish a Precedent,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he wrote James Madison, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is devoutly wished on my part, that these precedents may be fixed on true principles.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Born in 1732 into a Virginia planter family, he learned the morals, manners, and body of knowledge requisite for an 18th century Virginia gentleman. He pursued two intertwined interests: military arts and western expansion. At 16 he helped survey Shenandoah lands for Thomas, Lord Fairfax. Commissioned a lieutenant colonel in 1754, he fought the first skirmishes of what grew into the French and Indian War. The next year, as an aide to Gen. Edward Braddock, he escaped injury although four bullets ripped his coat and two horses were shot from under him. From 1759 to the outbreak of the American Revolution, Washington managed his lands around Mount Vernon and served in the Virginia House of Burgesses. Married to a widow, Martha Dandridge Custis, he devoted himself to a busy and happy life. But like his fellow planters, Washington felt himself exploited by British merchants and hampered by British regulations. As the quarrel with the mother country grew acute, he moderately but firmly voiced his resistance to the restrictions. When the Second Continental Congress assembled in Philadelphia in May 1775, Washington, one of the Virginia delegates, was elected Commander in Chief of the Continental Army. On July 3, 1775, at Cambridge, Massachusetts, he took command of his ill-trained troops and embarked upon a war that was to last six grueling years. He realized early that the best strategy was to harass the British. He reported to Congress, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe should on all Occasions avoid a general Action, or put anything to the Risque, unless compelled by a necessity, into which we ought never to be drawn.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ensuing battles saw him fall back slowly, then strike unexpectedly. Finally in 1781 with the aid of French allies\u00e2\u0080\u0093he forced the surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown. Washington longed to retire to his fields at Mount Vernon. But he soon realized that the Nation under its Articles of Confederation was not functioning well, so he became a prime mover in the steps leading to the Constitutional Convention at Philadelphia in 1787. When the new Constitution was ratified, the Electoral College unanimously elected Washington President. He did not infringe upon the policy making powers that he felt the Constitution gave Congress. But the determination of foreign policy became preponderantly a Presidential concern. When the French Revolution led to a major war between France and England, Washington refused to accept entirely the recommendations of either his Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson, who was pro-French, or his Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton, who was pro-British. Rather, he insisted upon a neutral course until the United States could grow stronger. To his disappointment, two parties were developing by the end of his first term. Wearied of politics, feeling old, he retired at the end of his second. In his Farewell Address, he urged his countrymen to forswear excessive party spirit and geographical distinctions. In foreign affairs, he warned against long-term alliances. Washington enjoyed less than three years of retirement at Mount Vernon, for he died of a throat infection December 14, 1799. For months the Nation mourned him. Learn more about George Washington\u00e2\u0080\u0099s spouse, Martha Dandridge Custis Washington.

Gilbert Stuart: portrait of George Washington George Washington, oil painting by Gilbert Stuart, c. 1803; in the White House. The work is based on Gilbert's unfinished painting of Washington known as the Athenaeum portrait (1796). (more) George Washington ,  (born Feb. 22, 1732, Westmoreland county, Va.\u2014died Dec. 14, 1799, Mount Vernon, Va., U.S.), American Revolutionary commander-in-chief (1775\u201383) and first president of the U.S. (1789\u201397). Born into a wealthy family, he was educated privately. In 1752 he inherited his brother\u2019s estate at Mount Vernon , including 18 slaves; their ranks grew to 49 by 1760, though he disapproved of slavery. In the French and Indian War he was commissioned a colonel and sent to the Ohio Territory. After Edward Braddock was killed, Washington became commander of all Virginia forces, entrusted with defending the western frontier (1755\u201358). He resigned to manage his estate and in 1759 married Martha Dandridge Custis (1731\u20131802), a widow. He served in the House of Burgesses (1759\u201374), where he supported the colonists\u2019 cause, and later in the Continental Congress (1774\u201375). In 1775 he was elected to command the Continental Army. In the ensuing American Revolution, he proved a brilliant commander and a stalwart leader, despite several defeats. With the war effectively ended by the capture of Yorktown (1781), he resigned his commission and returned to Mount Vernon (1783). He was a delegate to and presiding officer of the Constitutional Convention (1787) and helped secure ratification of the Constitution in Virginia. When the state electors met to select the first president (1789), Washington was the unanimous choice. He formed a cabinet to balance sectional and political differences but was committed to a strong central government. Elected to a second term, he followed a middle course between the political factions that later became the Federalist Party and the Democratic Party . He proclaimed a policy of neutrality in the war between Britain and France (1793) and sent troops to suppress the Whiskey Rebellion (1794). He declined to serve a third term (thereby setting a 144-year precedent) and retired in 1797 after delivering his \u201cFarewell Address.\u201d Known as the \u201cfather of his country,\u201d he is universally regarded as one of the greatest figures in U.S. history.

After the early death of his father, a young George Washington (only seven years old at the time) \n\t\t\t\tlearned the ways of farming and planting as he became the primary owner of his family's plantation farm.  He stayed at home throughout his early teenage years, helping his mother run the family's estate. At the age of fifteen, George became a surveyor. He was able to land this prestigious job through vital connections that his older brother, Lawrence Washington, possessed. Lawrence Washington was close partners with the wealthy \n\t\t\t\tColonel William Fairfax, a very wealthy Virginian politician and landholder. After receiving a good word from the influential Colonel Fairfax, George Washington not only became a successful surveyor, but also was placed in a \n\t\t\t\tposition to gain land and political positions. Upon the death of his brother Lawrence, George achieved his first political position in Virginia's Northern District.  Furthermore, Colonel Fairfax took the young Washington under his \n\t\t\t\twing as a role model and a sort of surrogate father, fostering in the ambitious George Washington a yearning to also learn about the art of war. Following a failed attempt to enter the British Royal Navy (thwarted, in part, by George's mother), Washington finally got his chance to serve in the militia. Much of the surveying work that George did was for the Ohio Company, \n\t\t\t\toperated by the Fairfax family. A dispute between France and Great Britain over western lands in the Ohio territory prompted Fairfax to send George Washington on a scouting expedition to the lands in question. His mission was to \n\t\t\t\tdeliver notice to the encamped French forces that the land was claimed by the British. Straying from his original orders, the impulsive young commander led an attack on a French scouting party. Not only was this attack Washington's \n\t\t\t\tfirst taste of the battlefield, but also it was crucial in sparking the Seven Years War between the two main colonizers of North America: France and Britain. Upon returning to Virginia, Washington joined the British imperial army, serving under General Braddock. It was during the Seven Year's War that Washington first achieved a hero's status on the battlefield during his mid-twenties. \n\t\t\t\tIn one account, General Braddock and his army walked into a French and Indian ambush. As British officers rapidly fell in the battle, George Washington remained alive, surviving bullet holes in his jacket and horses being shot \n\t\t\t\tout from underneath him. He did his best to carry out the wounded General Braddock's orders for the remainder of the tragic battle. Although the battle was a horrific loss for the British forces, Washington returned to Virginia \n\t\t\t\tas a war hero. Although this status was not fully merited (due to Washington's significant lack of military knowledge), it helped to boost his popularity in the eyes of both the public and the  prominent. After the end of the Seven Years War, Washington returned to civilian life with his marriage to a wealthy Virginian widow named Martha Dandridge Custis. George's marriage to Martha united both of their already wealthy estates. \n\t\t\t\tTherefore, Washington spent much of his time after the war tending and expanding his vast estate. Moreover, the newly famous Washington re-entered politics as a representative in the Virginia House of Burgesses. However, life \n\t\t\t\tduring this time of peace was short-lived as the pivotal encounters with the British at the battles of Lexington and Concord soon propelled the American colonies into the Revolutionary War against their mother country, Great Britain. In June 1775, George Washington was appointed the Commander in Chief of the Continental Army. Washington's experience as the commander of the colonial forces was a mixture of success and failure, embarrassment and glory. \n\t\t\t\tOne of his most significant losses was the capture and occupation of New York City by the British forces. The loss of this major colonial city greatly frustrated Washington, but every latter attempt he made to retake New York \n\t\t\t\teither failed or never materialized. On the other hand, his two small victories at Trenton, New Jersey and Princeton, New Jersey were crucial in both mending Washington's reputation as a war general and in boosting morale \n\t\t\t\tamong the rebel colonial forces and civilians. After several other key victories with the aid of the colonies' foreign ally France, the British ended the Revolutionary War and relinquished their control of the American colonies \n\t\t\t\twith the signing of the Treaty of Paris at Yorktown, Virginia on September 3, 1783. Following the conclusion of the American War for Independence, George Washington initially refused to become the national leader and instead returned again to civilian life in order to tend to his suffering estate. However, \n\t\t\t\tWashington did shortly accept the invitation to run for the office of the first President of the United States of America. At the age of fifty-seven, he became the only U.S. President to receive every vote from the Electoral \n\t\t\t\tCollege. George Washington served two terms as President, afterwards retiring for one last time to his home at Mount Vernon. The United State's first President, icon, and national hero died in his home on December 14, 1799. \n\t\t\t\tNowadays George Washington is recognized as the most admired founding fathers of the United States of America, along with Thomas Jefferson , and Benjamin Franklin . \u00a9 Copyright www.GeorgeWashington.org All Rights Reserved Designed by www.GeorgeWashington.org"
